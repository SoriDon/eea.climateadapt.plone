      <p>In Austria, a national adaptation strategy (NAS) was adopted on 23rd
        October 2012 by the Council of Ministers and endorsed by the Provincial
        Governors Conference on 16th May 2013. The Austrian NAS consists of two
        parts: a Strategic Framework (or "Context") and an Action Plan (BMNT,

        also available in English. The aim of the Austrian NAS is to avoid the
        adverse effects of climate change on the environment, society, and the
        economy and to fully utilise any opportunities that may arise.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Adaptation Strategies</h3>
      <p>The NAS aims to create a national framework to ensure coordination and
        harmonisation of the various climate adaptation activities in all areas.
        In August 2017, a revised version of the NAS was adopted by the Austrian
        Council of Ministers, which was subsequently also approved by the
        Conference of the Governors of the Bundesländer (NUTS II) in November
        2017. This new version aims to update and further develop the NAS, while
        preserving its overall structure.</p>
      <p>A national adaptation plan (NAP) was adopted in 2012 (as part of the
        NAS) and revised in 2016 (and approved together with the revised NAS in
        2017). The NAP presents a catalogue of 135 adaptation options for 14
        areas of action. These areas are: agriculture, forestry, water resources
        and water management, tourism, energy (with a focus on the electricity
        industry), protection from natural hazards, construction and housing,
        disaster risk management, health, ecosystems and biodiversity,
        transportation infrastructure and selected aspects of mobility, spatial
        planning, business/industry/trade, and cities (with a focus on urban
        green and open spaces). The drafting process was characterized by the
        extensive and active participation of representatives from the federal
        ministries, the provincial states, interest groups, stakeholders, NGOs,
        and other institutions. The Environment Agency Austria (EAA) was
        actively involved in various aspects of the strategy's development;
        among other things, it organized the participation process with more
        than 100 institutions.</p>
      <h3>Implementation means</h3>
      <p>With regard to implementation, the Austrian Adaptation Strategy and
        Action Plan provides concrete recommendations in the 14 areas for action
        and describes those in detail in the corresponding Action Plan, in which
        also the key actors, potential conflicts and time horizons for
        implementation are noted for each recommendation and measure. For
        successful implementation of the NAS, a lot of effort is being made to
        ensure best possible cooperation between all actors concerned. In terms
        of provision of resources, the following premises apply for the
        implementation of the Austrian Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The implementation of the recommendations must be achieved within
          the existing jurisdictions of all governmental authorities (federal,
          provincial states, local);
        </li>
        <li>All recommendations listed in the Austrian Action Plan are to be
          covered by the resources available in the applicable financial
          frameworks of the public sector (federal, provincial states, local);
        </li>
        <li>The costs of implementing the recommendations are to be covered by
          prioritization and shifting within the available budget.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In many cases, implementation of the recommendations will require the
        cooperation of various actors in the public sector (federal, provincial
        states, local) and the private sector. To ensure fair burden-sharing,
        cooperation within the public sector and between the public and private
        sectors is recommendable and meaningful. A new funding program (<span
            class="link-external"><a

            data-val="https://klar-anpassungsregionen.at/klar-programm/">KLAR!-Climate Change Adaptation Model Regions for Austria</a></span>)&nbsp;is

        climate resilience in vulnerable sectors. The program has been launched
        in September 2016 and ran until the end of 2017 for the initial phase,
        with a volume of 800.000 Euro to support adaptation efforts in regions.
        Until the end of March 2017, regions and municipalities were invited to
        submit their applications including a basic concept to the Climate and
        Energy Fund, who initiated the KLAR! programme in cooperation with the
        Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT).</p>
      <p>Since 2018 and up until 2019, beneficiaries are now working on
        implementing the measures laid out in these concepts with a financial
        support of 2,1 Million EURO. In a third phase post-2020, the action
        plans and their executed measures will then be evaluated. Since October
        2018, new regions can apply in the initial phase until March 29, 2019.
        New regional climate scenarios were funded to support regional
        adaptation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism,
        together with the provincial states have financed various capacity
        building activities for the regional and local level (e.g. workshops in
        regions, brochure with 11 good-practice examples on adaptation from
        regions across Austria).</p>
      <h3>Monitoring, reporting and evaluation</h3>
      <p>A progress report was published by the BMNT in 2015 (BMNT, formerly

        described in the NAP. Monitoring and evaluation of the NAS/NAP is
        pragmatic and comprises two modules:&nbsp;1) a self-assessment approach
        using a stakeholder survey based on the NAP and sent to the key actors
        mentioned therein;&nbsp;2) an indicator-based approach with qualitative
        and quantitative data collections (BMNT, formerly BMLFUW (2014). <span

        Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water
        Management, Vienna). The results from the progress report show that
        implementation and mainstreaming of adaptation is increasing in Austria
        with a different level of progress in the various areas of action. The
        results were of high relevance for the first updated version of the
        Austrian Adaptation Strategy and its Action Plan as of 2017.</p>
      <h3>Schedule and planned review/revision</h3>
      <div>2nd Progress Report is foreseen for 2020.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane  " id="4489-2">
      <p>The recommendations for the 14 areas have been developed beyond generic
        recommendations and include specific information for implementation such
        as responsibilities, existing instruments to be used for mainstreaming
        adaptation, time frame for implementation, and required resources, etc.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Sectors addressed in NAS/NAP</h3>
      <p>Adaptation recommendations have been identified and assessed on the
        basis of qualitative vulnerability assessment for nine sectors (i.e.
        water, tourism, agriculture, forestry, electricity and energy, housing
        and construction, health, ecosystems and biodiversity and
        transport/infrastructure). The scientific community was strongly
        involved in the process of developing proposals for adaptation options
        for certain areas of action. Also many stakeholders from the organised
        public (e.g. federal and provincial ministries or related institutions,
        interest groups and social/environmental NGOs) were consulted to
        complement the adaptation recommendations.</p>
      <p>In total, 135 recommendations in the NAP have been formulated with the
        number of recommendations per field of activity/area of action ranging
        from three (tourism) to fourteen (agriculture). In most cases, the
        recommendations for action represent rather bundles of discrete further
        steps needed to accomplish the respective adaptation goal than single
        specific measures. The recommendations for action are available at
        national level, sub-national level, sectoral level and cross-sectoral
        level. The following types of adaptation options were identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grey options (i.e. technological, such as river flood protection,
          beach nourishment)
        </li>
        <li>Green options (i.e. ecosystem-based approaches that use nature's
          multiple services, such as crop diversification, enhancing the ability
          of indigenous plant and animal species to move across landscapes)
        </li>
        <li>Soft options (i.e. managerial, legal and policy approaches, such as
          awareness-raising initiatives, passing legislation, creating early
          warning systems, insurance, planning instruments)
        </li>
        <li>Combined options</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each measure described follows the same structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content items elaborated for each recommendation</li>
        <li>Goal</li>
        <li>Relevance</li>
        <li>Relation to other activity fields</li>
        <li>Relation to existing instruments</li>
        <li>Status of implementation</li>
        <li>Recommended further steps</li>
        <li>Possible resource needs</li>
        <li>Conflict potentials</li>
        <li>Implementing actors and</li>
        <li>time horizon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Areas for action of the NAS/NAP have not been prioritised, but criteria
        for prioritisation are identified in the NAS. In general, measures that
        provide benefits independent of climate change ("win-win") or measures
        that entail no disadvantages in case the actual climate trends do not
        correspond to projections ("no-regret") should be prioritised, as well
        as flexible measures. Furthermore, prioritisation according to the
        "Europe 2020: A strategy for intelligent, sustainable, and inclusive
        growth" is suggested.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Mainstreaming of adaptation</h3>
      <p>The integration of adaptation into sectoral policies and programmes and
        thus mainstreaming is increasing with practical examples in agriculture,
        forestry, biodiversity, health, water management and natural hazard
        management. Climate adaptation is addressed in the amendment to the
        Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Law in Austria in 2018. The
        guidance documents for conducting EIA Reports are currently being
        revised in order to comply with the requirements of the amended EIA
        Directive.</p>
      <p>The mainstreaming of climate adaptation into urban planning policies is
        visible for example in the <span class="link-external"><a
            href="https://www.wien.gv.at/stadtentwicklung/studien/pdf/b008379a.pdf"
            target="_blank">Vienna urban development plan 2025 (STEP 2025)</a></span>
        &nbsp;Climate adaptation measures are mentioned as an integral part of
        planning the management and enhancement of the city of the ‘<span

        developed by the city of Graz. Both are examples of a municipal strategy
        papers for urban planning that places ecological and climate-specific
        measures at its core. Social aspects also feature an important element
        in the NAS and need to be considered during the implementation of
        recommendations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane  " id="4489-3">The Austrian NAS (2017) contains a
      qualitative vulnerability assessment for nine sectors (i.e. water,
      tourism, agriculture, forestry, electricity and energy, housing and
      construction, health, ecosystems and biodiversity and
      transport/infrastructure). It was carried out by the Environment Agency
      Austria in cooperation with the Institute of Meteorology of the University
      of Natural Resources and Life Sciences. The vulnerability reports fed into
      the NAS. Separate studies have not been carried out for the other five
      sectors (protection from natural hazards, disaster risk management,
      spatial planning, business/industry/trade, cities). Nevertheless, a
      descriptive vulnerability assessment has been included in the NAP 2017 for
      all 14 sectors, although it highlights the differences in the level of
      knowledge and detail across sectors.
      <h3>Observations and projections</h3>
      <p>Observations and data are available for the last 250 years in the
        greater alpine region (HistAlp-Dataset). The longest temperature and air
        pressure series extend back to 1760, precipitation to 1800, cloudiness
        to the 1840s and sunshine to the 1880s in the alpine region. Projections
        are available for the Alpine region for temperature, precipitation,
        heat, heavy precipitation and storms.</p>
      <p>Data collection and provision is located at the Central Institute for
        Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) with meteorological stations
        measuring temperature, precipitation, wind, sunshine and many other
        meteorological parameters. New regional climate scenarios for Austria
        and its nine provincial states have been available since autumn 2016.
        The scenarios are based on 13 EURO-CORDEX models, a 12.5km x 12.5 km
        grid, and use two greenhouse gas scenarios. Results are available via
        the Climate Change Centre Austria (CCCA) data portal (<span

      </p>
      <h3>Impact and Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
      <p>The Austrian Panel on Climate Change (APCC) has conducted a
        comprehensive assessment to document and integrate current scientific
        knowledge of climate change and its anticipated impacts on Austria as
        well as presents the needs and possibilities for mitigation and
        adaptation. The APCC report was published in September 2014, after the
        release of the IPCC Working Group III 5th Assessment Report. The
        Austrian Assessment Report 2014 (AAR14) is based on the IPCC structure
        and process; it consists of three volumes that present the existing
        knowledge on climate change in Austria, and on the needs and
        possibilities for mitigation and adaptation. The report aims to present
        the scientific knowledge pertaining to Austria in a coherent and
        complete manner to submit this in the form of policy-relevant
        information to the Austrian Federal Government and political
        decision-making bodies at all levels, and thereby providing a
        decision-making basis for the private sector and a knowledge base for
        academic institutions.</p>
      <p>Similar to the IPCC assessment reports, the AAR14 is based on the
        principle of being policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive. In a
        joint, three-year effort approximately 240 Austrian scientists have
        developed this first progress report on climate change in Austria, and
        thus summarized the current state of knowledge on the characteristics of
        climate change in Austria, its consequences, and mitigation and
        adaptation strategies. Among the achievements of the report are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased robustness of scientific data through integration of the
          findings of different research approaches and methods.
        </li>
        <li>Development of data that can better inform societal decision making
          on climate change issues.
        </li>
        <li>Provision of policy-relevant technical support for strategies
          developed to respond to climate change, and work on responses with the
          European Union and other international organizations.
        </li>
        <li>Identification of knowledge gaps that can be addressed by future
          research.
        </li>
        <li>Building of an active network of Austrian research institutions,
          individual scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to carry
          work on climate change forward.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Further assessments of the APCC are planned with the focus on specific
        topics. The first <span class="link-external"><a
            href="https://sr18.ccca.ac.at/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
            data-linktype="external" data-val="https://sr18.ccca.ac.at/">special report addressed health, demography and climate change</a></span>&nbsp;and
        was published in September 2018. A <span class="link-external"><a

        on the way and expected for 2019. More special reports can be expected
        in the years to come.</p>
      <p>At regional level, some provincial states have conducted
        vulnerability/impact assessments for their territories and priority
        sectors: Lower Austria (for forestry, agriculture, energy, water and
        winter tourism), Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria and Tyrol. Upper
        Austria, Styria, Tyrol, Salzburg and Vorarlberg have already adopted a
        regional adaptation strategy, an integrated climate strategy for
        Carinthia was finalised in 2018. Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland
        are mainstreaming adaptation into existing policies, such as climate
        mitigation plans.</p>
      <p>With regard to<strong> economic assessments</strong>, a scientific
        evaluation of the financial consequences of climate change in Austria
        was presented in January 2015 as results of an ACRP project, Costs of
        Inaction (<span class="link-external"><a href="https://coin.ccca.ac.at/"
                                                 rel="noopener" target="_blank"

        . This analysis and documentation on the "costs of inaction" provide the
        basis for further applied research under the ACRP on the costs of
        adaptation measures. The main results of two projects <span

      <h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>
      <p>Climate research has rapidly evolved in recent years in Austria. The
        national climate research programme StartClim and the Austrian Climate
        Research Program (ACRP) of the Climate and Energy Fund provide important
        and forward-looking results. In addition, significant insight has been
        obtained through the former research programme proVISION of the Federal
        Ministry for Science, Research and Economy and the Global Change
        Programme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.</p>
      <p>Given the dimensions of climate change, institutionalized cooperation
        in climate and climate impact research is urgently needed in Austria.
        Upon the initiative of Austrian universities, the Climate Change Centre
        Austria (CCCA) was formally established in 2011. The objective of the
        CCCA is to improve the quality and efficiency of Austrian climate
        research through networking and the promotion of cooperation, but also
        to enhance its international visibility. As a focal point for research,
        policy, media, and the public, and for all questions of climate research
        in Austria, it serves to foster a sustainable national climate dialogue.
        The CCCA is organized as an association and currently holds 21 full
        members and 4 associate members, including numerous universities and
        non-academic research institutions.</p>
      <h3>Monitoring progress</h3>
      <p>In 2014, a concept for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) has been
        published, which aims to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor the implementation of the Austrian Adaptation Strategy;</li>
        <li>Provide an overview on the progress of adaptation and information on
          key trends of vulnerabilities;
        </li>
        <li>Create awareness for the need of adaptation as well as highlight
          gaps and key challenges;
        </li>
        <li>Provide a basis for continued development (review) of the NAS.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The M&amp;E system follows a pragmatic approach and is closely related
        to the Action Plan. It comprises two modules: the first module is a
        stakeholder survey ("self-assessment approach"; based on the Action plan
        and sent to the key actors mentioned therein); the second module
        presents a criteria-approach ("indicator-based approach" with
        qualitative and quantitative data collections). The joint consideration
        of these two components provided a broad picture of the implementation
        of the NAS and key adaptation trends in Austria.</p>
      <p>The M&amp;E scheme was developed together with stakeholders by
        involving them in workshops and personal interviews. Based on the
        results from the self-assessment and the data collection based on
        indicators, a first progress report of the state of implementation of
        the Austrian Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan was published in 2015.
        It shows that the measures recommended in the NAP have been or are being
        implemented in all activity fields although the level of progress varies
        from sector to sector. Future M&amp;E and reporting is planned on a
        five-year-cycle. The 2nd progress report is expected for 2020.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane  " id="4489-4">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In Austria, the BMNT (formerly, BMLFUW) holds overall responsibility
        for adaptation policy-making (Division IV/1 of the BMNT). One of its
        main assignments is to provide guidance by keeping the NAS and NAP
        updated, as well as by drafting the progress report on its
        implementation. The NAP is implemented in collaboration with a wide
        range of fellow federal ministries, regional government actors and
        sector stakeholders from the public and private sector.</p>
      <h3><strong></strong><strong>Governance</strong></h3>
      <p>All federal ministries were invited to join the NAS and NAP development
        process and to provide feedback and comments on the document via three
        rounds of written consultations. More precisely, the Inter-Ministerial
        Committee to Coordinate Measures to Protect Global Climate (IMC Climate
        Change) was regularly updated on the status of work towards the NAS.
        According to the latest amendment of the Austrian Climate Protection
        Law, §°4 (2), instead of the IMC the National Climate Protection
        Committee is in charge of adaptation to unavoidable climate impacts. The
        Committee meets at least once a year and is chaired by the BMNT.</p>
      <p>Given the holistic and cross-sectoral nature of adaptation action,
        there is a need for horizontal coordination in the implementation phase
        as well. In accordance with the current division of competences (after
        the national election in 2017), the BMNT holds a much broader range of
        responsibilities as concerns areas of action in climate change. The
        National Climate Protection Committee is the relevant institutional
        body, set up by law, to provide sectoral coordination of adaptation and
        mitigation measures. The Austrian Spatial Planning Concept (<span
            class="link-external"><a
            href="https://www.oerok.gv.at/fileadmin/Bilder/2.Reiter-Raum_u._Region/1.OEREK/OEREK_2011/Dokumente_OEREK_2011/OEREK_2011_EN_Downloadversion.pdf"

        also calls for the continued organisation of "round table" meetings
        between sectoral representatives to discuss relevant climate-related
        issues during the implementation of measures.</p>
      <p>The Bundesländer are highly committed to cooperating with the Federal
        Ministry (BMNT) on climate adaptation. Climate coordination
        officers/units have been installed in all provincial governments and act
        as the main agents of vertical cooperation with the Federal Ministry for
        Sustainability and Tourism (Nachmany et al. 2015). The Federal Ministry
        for Sustainability and Tourism together with all Bundesländer (decision
        taken by the LURK&nbsp; "Provincial Environmental Speakers" Conference)
        has established an implementation plan summarising a few specific
        measures to be implemented in close cooperation. One of the <span

        the implementation of "dialogue events" in various Austrian cities.
        Twelve such dialogue events took place in 2016 and 2017. As a next step,
        more specific participatory measures were undertaken such as, a working

        events. In addition, stronger joint efforts were agreed to support
        adaptation at regional level (e.g. through regional workshops, and a

      <p>The National Climate Protection Committee is the relevant institutional
        body, set up by law, to provide vertical (and sectoral) coordination of
        adaptation and mitigation measures. Furthermore, the Environment Agency
        Austria (EAA) fulfilled an important role as a semi-public support unit
        regarding several strands of activities throughout the entire NAS/NAP
        process. The support roles delivered by the EAA included the provision
        of technical expertise (as author, contributor or coordinator of
        preparatory expert studies), the drafting and editing of the policy
        paper, and implementation of various information activities towards the
        public. A broad participatory process conducted by the EAA was
        accompanying the strategy development from summer 2008 until summer
        2011. All results gained from the participatory process are considered
        in the development of the NAS/NAP. Representatives of the provincial
        states and further relevant stakeholders (including scientists and
        representatives from other Federal Ministries) have also been involved
        in the establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation system in Austria.
        The chosen approach (stakeholder survey and data collection) also
        ensures ongoing interaction across governance levels ad sectors. Diverse
        participatory elements were used for the revision of the NAP/NAS in 2016
        and 2017 as well as in the ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation
        process.</p>
      <h3>Knowledge</h3>
      With regard to knowledge transfer, the website of the BMNT reports about
      the ongoing political processes and further relevant activities on
      adaptation to climate change at the national level. As part of the
      participatory process accompanying the development of the Austrian
      Adaptation Strategy, a <span class="link-external"><a
        href="http://www.klimawandelanpassung.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
        data-linktype="external" data-val="http://www.klimawandelanpassung.at">national climate change adaptation portal</a></span>&nbsp;was
      set up to present Austria-specific information on climate change and
      adaptation, which also includes a database on adaptation research and
      practice. This platform is gradually expanding and serves as an entry
      point to up-to-date information on adaptation in Austria. Examples
      provided at the database shall help to increase general understanding of
      adaptation, and demonstrate that many initiatives involving adaptation
      have already been undertaken; although not necessarily under the headline
      of climate change adaptation.
      <p>In addition to the information available on the Internet, since January
        2011 a regular newsletter on climate change adaptation provides
        practical information for governmental decision-makers, interest groups,
        private sector, etc. (designed and implemented by the Environment Agency
        Austria with financing from the Climate and Energy Fund).</p>
      <p>The Austrian Met Service (ZAMG) runs an c<span class="link-external"><a

          data-val="https://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/informationsportal-klimawandel">limate change information portal</a></span>&nbsp;since
        2010. This platform seeks to present sound scientific information on
        climate change in an understandable form. Furthermore, the Climate
        Change Centre Austria (CCCA) has set up a website which provides climate
        knowledge and climate data as well as and informs about research
        activities and relevant events. Also the website <span
            class="link-external"><a href="http://klimartikulieren.at/"

        relevant information materials like animated videos, climate
        communication, fact-check on climate change and other relevant material.
      </p>
      <p>Key results of the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) have been
        published regularly under the title "<span class="link-external"><a
            href="https://www.klimafonds.gv.at/publication/acrp-in-essence/"

        since 2014. They are summarizing outcomes of the ACRP research projects
        in a nut shell and aiming to make those outcomes accessible to policy
        makers and politicians. In order to support politicians and experts in
        the public administration of provincial states, regions and cities, as
        well as actors in regional management in developing adaptation
        strategies, a handbook with methods and tools which helps to tackle the
        challenges of adaptation was published. It provides guidance for the
        strategic and proactive examination of climate change impacts. The
        handbook is one of the main results of the project FAMOUS (Factory of
        Adaptation Measures operated ad different Scales) financed by the
        Climate and Energy Fund.</p>
      <p>More guidelines have been developed on a variety of issues concerning
        the integration of adaptation as part of research projects, mainly
        financed by the ACRP. Examples are the research projects CcTalK!, which
        provided knowledge on how to communicate climate change adaptation to be
        able to increase awareness and motivate stakeholder to act on
        adaptation. Also the project ARISE developed a support system for
        climate-sensitive iterative risk management as a key adaptation
        approach. The "<span class="link-external"><a

        as part of the research project ENVISAGE-CC, funded by the ACRP was
        published. The project succeeded in raising awareness of climate impacts
        with developers of large-scale infrastructure Projects, subject to EIA.
        The follow-up project <span class="link-external"><a

        (SPEcific Climate change ForesIght in projeCt design) has broadened the
        target audience to environmental authorities and consultants (EIA
        assessors/practitioners), and focused on rail, highway and power grid

      <p>For raising public awareness on impacts and adaptation to climate
        change, the BMNT has published two brochures, one with sound arguments

        from sub-national stakeholders for concrete real-world cases
        demonstrating municipal adaptation in practice.</p>
      <h3>International dimensions</h3>
      <p>In the NAS/NAP, cooperation to address common challenges with
        neighbouring countries is not explicitly addressed. Nevertheless,
        Austria is participating in several international partnerships that are
        actively working on climate change and adaptation issues, although it is
        not clear how these interact with the Austrian strategic approach to
        adaptation.&nbsp;</p>
      Austria is a contracting Party to the International Commission for the
      Protection of the Danube River, which adopted a <span

      in 2012. The Strategy is based on a thorough assessment of possible
      climate impacts and suggests possible means to adapt to and mitigate them.
      Austria is also a member country of the Alpine Convention, a framework
      that sets out general measures for sustainable development in the Alpine
      region. A <span class="link-external"><a

      the Alps. In addition, the recently established Advisory Committee on the
      Alpine Climate (Alpine Climate Board), chaired by Austria under the Alpine
      Convention gathers climate change specialists from the eight Alpine States
      and observer organisations. The board will prepare recommendations for
      future reinforced action, for the attention of the next Alpine Conference
      in 2019, with the establishment of a climate-neutral Alpine space 2050 as
      the overarching goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
