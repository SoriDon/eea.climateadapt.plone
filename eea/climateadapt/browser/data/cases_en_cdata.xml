    <field_title><![CDATA[Adaptation, restoration and creation of habitats for amphibians threatened by climate change in the Montes de Valsaín mountain range, Segovia]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p>Amphibians suffer a global decline. This has made them the most threatened group of vertebrates on the planet, with more than a third of the species under some degree of threat. The main threats include the destruction of their habitat, changes in climate, emerging diseases and the disappearance of places of reproduction. This project consists in an intervention for the conservation and improvement of the populations of the eleven species of amphibians inhabiting the Montes de Valsaín Mountain Range (Segovia) through a series of undertakings to protect the ponds already existing in the area and to create new spaces suitable for the reproduction of different species.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p>The Montes de Valsaín mountain range is located on the northern slope of the Sierra de Guadarrama, in the municipality of the Real Sitio de San Ildefonso. They constitute a forest area of 10,668 ha and are State-owned Public Utility Forests, managed by the National Parks Autonomous Organization (OAPN) through the Centro Montes y Aserradero de Valsaín.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a well-preserved area that gathers several protective attributes, including among others: Natural Site of National Interest - declared as early as 1930 -, Special Protection Area for Birds (ZEPA), Special Conservation Zone (ZEC) and Natural Park and Biosphere Reserve. In addition, since 2013, 3,326 ha of the Montes de Valsaín mountain range have been incorporated into the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park and another 7,011 ha have been included within the Peripheral Protection Zone as a Special Protection Area of the National Park, obtaining a similar legal regime to that of the National Park.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the area, Albar pine trees (Pinus sylvestris) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) groves predominate. Broom, creeping juniper and high mountain grasslands can be found at higher elevations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the lines of work of the Conservation and Monitoring Area of ​​the Montes de Valsaín Center is to contribute to the conservation and recovery of the amphibian communities that inhabit the area, one of the groups most affected by climate change and the resulting modifications in both habitat and ecosystems. Amphibians are closely linked to aquatic ecosystems and, in particular, to the existence of permanent or temporary ponds where they can lay their eggs and complete full metamorphosis toward adulthood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus, the survival of amphibian populations depends directly -among other variables - on the existence of water surfaces, whose viability is being highly compromised locally, regionally and globally, due to the lower precipitation and higher temperatures linked to climate change. In addition, the loss and fragmentation of habitats and the onset of new diseases (caused by viruses, bacteria and fungi) are seriously contributing to the decline of amphibian communities throughout the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The results obtained from the Amphibian Monitoring works carried out at the Montes de Valsaín Center indicated the need to establish zones that favor the reproduction and mobility of these species, avoiding as much as possible the mortality of both adults and larvae.</p>

    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p>Conservation and improvement of the populations belonging to the eleven species of amphibians that inhabit the Montes de Valsaín mountain range (Segovia) through a series of actions aimed at protecting the ponds already existing in the area – through fencing fundamentally - and creating new suitable spaces for the reproduction of the different species - excavations on the ground that could act naturally as new pools and fencing thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Improvement of the availability of aquatic habitats and thereby improve the diversity of plant and wildlife associated therewith.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Favor other wild species not directly linked to these aquatic environments, but which do use them to drink.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_measures><![CDATA[Structural/physical: Ecosystemic options, Social: Education options]]></field_measures>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago it was decided to initiate an intervention project for the conservation and improvement of the populations of the eleven species of amphibians that inhabit the Montes de Valsaín mountain range: salamander (Salamandra salamandra), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), common toad (Bufo spinosus), Natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita), common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans), Iberian spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes), Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi), common frog (Pelophylax perezi), Iberian frog (Rana iberica) and San Anton frog (Hyla molleri). The project began with the diagnosis of the baseline situation and the specific reproduction requirements that each of the species had, as a starting point from which to develop a series of actions to protect the ponds already existing in the area - through fencing fundamentally - and to create new spaces suitable for the reproduction of different species - excavations on the ground that could act naturally as new pools and fencing thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases, it entailed recovering spaces that had been lost due to lack of use, as is the case of some ponds that were used to provide livestock with drinking water and that have become clogged due to lack of maintenance work. In others, it entailed adapting places that are good for amphibians and which require certain undertakings such as fencing, to avoid trampling by livestock and to provide refuge areas. In addition, new pools are created in places suitable for amphibians, but which lack a habitat for their reproduction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wet areas of different dimensions have been created using a wheeled backhoe to prevent damaging the surrounding areas. Depths have varied according to the zones, with an average of 1.5 m and adapting to the terrain to avoid large earth movements. The excavated earth was dumped on the sides of the excavation in order to increase the capacity; slopes were smoothened out so that the final result is as natural as possible, and vegetation settles itself on them, fixing them into place. Water evacuation pipes operating from one level were installed, preventing the water from overflowing and damaging the retaining structure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enclosures with treated wooden posts have also been installed to avoid damages caused by trampling and overgrazing by livestock, with the resulting damage to amphibians. Fences are permeable for wildlife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The interventions do not include the relocation or transfer of animals from one pond to another. Thus, colonization by different species (not only amphibians, also plants and other animals) is absolutely natural.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together with these in situ conservation measures, an ex situ conservation measure has been launched by the Montes de Valsaín Center. The intervention consists in removing the larvae of amphibians which, as a result of the early drying of the ponds due to the increase in temperature and variations in the distribution of precipitation, would die due to their inability to complete metamorphosis, and transferring them to suitable facilities where they can complete the cycle and become adults. Later, they are relocated again to their original habitats, thus reinforcing the populations. In no case are specimens that could be naturally viable removed from the land and so far, no artificial recolonizations are carried out in places other than those from which the larvae were extracted.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p>The Montes de Valsaín mountain range is located in the northern slope of the Sierra de Guadarrama and are Mountains of Public Utility (Mountains 1 and 2 of the CUP of the province of Segovia), owned by the State and managed by the National Parks Autonomous Organization through the Montes and Aserradero de Valsaín Center, where the Plant and Wildlife Conservation and Monitoring Area responsible for the project works.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interpretive signs describing this undertaking and the problem it faces have been installed in the vicinity of the works. These panels provide information on the purpose of these works, raising awareness of the consequences that climate change can bring, particularly in the case of amphibians and their vulnerability.</p>
<p>As an added component to the work carried out, these actions have been endowed with an informative component. To this end, various materials have been developed that are available on the OAPN website. The materials produced are aimed at a wide variety of target audiences, ranging from more technical information collected in a book featuring photographic reports of the works, to knowledge and awareness materials aimed at children, to other informative elements such as guide to the types of amphibians present in the National Parks Network or a dichotomous key that allows their identification without the need to manipulate the observed specimens.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p>It is a type of undertakings that is not very demanding in terms of economic and technical resources, making replication in other locations relatively simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initial data in Valsaín point to a considerable success of the interventions carried out to date, with a rapid natural colonization of the ponds by the amphibian species existing in the area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the most complex aspects of the project is the definition of those places on which to intervene, which should be suitable for the formation of new ponds due to both their spatial location and the natural impermeability of the ground, since neither concrete nor plastics are used nor any type of artificial material. When the ground is not completely impermeable in the baseline situation, the progressive accumulation of organic matter helps to achieve this over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key element of the project is the monitoring and evaluation of the results - in this case, the amphibian populations in the different ponds - to which special attention and effort is paid. In this sense, it is very important to know that very high inter-annual variability exists in amphibian communities, which requires long periods of time in order to ascertain the population trends of the different species in the different places with a certain degree of rigor.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p>Budget financed through the PIMA-Adapta Plan of the Spanish Office of Climate Change (OECC) assigned to the OAPN for this specific purpose. In general, these are not actions involving high monetary amounts, which include: the cost of obtaining prior knowledge about the species, its requirements and threats; protective fencing; manual or mechanical excavation of a flood zone (if applicable); monitoring and control of the evolution of populations and the maintenance of the sheet of water in the built ponds, carried out by expert personnel; and in situ signage (where appropriate).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first data in Valsaín point to a very considerable success of the interventions carried out to date, with a rapid natural colonization of the ponds by the amphibian species existing in the area. And not only amphibians, but also a wide range of plant and wildlife species have made these spaces their own and have contributed to convert them into valuable habitats. In addition, the ponds are used as drinking troughs by mammals and birds, having become authentic oases in times of low water availability.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p>The Autonomous Community (Region) of the Basque Country has planning and management responsibilities in many areas that are sensitive to climate and, therefore, vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, more than 75% of the population lives in urban environments, facing specific and local problems derived from the impacts of climate change. The urban metabolism, understood as the flows of energy and the cycles of matter that circulate and feed the cities and territories where they settle, is specifically affected by the effects of climate change, which causes impacts in multiple areas, services and sectors where planning and management by local administrations can provide solutions that minimize their vulnerability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the international context of discussion on the policies of adaptation to climate change, a clear commitment can be perceived on measures that are based on the integration of nature in anthropized environments, highlighting also the importance and the potential of adaptation of the municipalities due to their urban transformation capacity and proximity to citizens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Green spaces and the “greening” trend are seen as a driver for change, particularly in the urban areas of the municipalities, turning inert asphalt into green, permeable areas. In the field of adaptation to climate change, Natural Solutions seem to be an opportunity.</p>

<li>Identify the spaces and urban elements available that can accommodate natural solutions.</li>
<li>Establish priorities and coordinate efforts to launch adaptation measures and actions in the most vulnerable spaces and with the greatest availability for deployment.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>It is a significant contribution to the progress of integrating adaptation into planning and management, and to the increase of the resilience of systems, sectors, resources and geographical areas vulnerable to climate change.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p>TECNALIA Research &#38; Innovation along with international partnerships has developed the NBS methodology thanks to the call of the KLIMATEK program: R + D projects, Innovation and demonstration on adaptation to climate change 2016, promoted by the Basque Government. In order to provide the project with a practical and demonstrative nature, the NBS methodology has been developed by applying it to the municipality of Donostia/San Sebastián. The results of the NBS mapping of this city will serve as the basis for the preparation of its Adaptation to Climate Change Plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main beneficiaries are:</p>
<p>- City councils and all the organizations that depend on them, which, in the performance of their functions, can promote and implement the mechanisms that favor a “green” presence in the municipality and an urban design that is more inclusive with nature.</p>
<p>- Private initiatives, in the case of projects in which the promoter is not the public administration, that seek to include some type of natural solution in their actions as a measure of adaptation.</p>
<p>- The public in general; any citizen who wishes to undertake a specific intervention in their property, so as to gain a broad and integrating vision of the benefits that this small intervention may have in the area in which it is located and in the municipality as a whole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Donostia - San Sebastian pilot project has been accompanied by a participatory process with the aim of contributing to the citizens’ knowledge and awareness of the problem of climate change and, at the same time, leveraging their own knowledge of the city by making them participants in the identification of spaces or elements that can host nature-based solutions based.</p>
<p>- Sharing the initiative with the Urban Planning, Projects and Public Works, Maintenance and Services and Environment-Biodiversity departments.</p>
<p>- Participatory session in UPV’s University Campus of the UPV.</p>
<p>- Sharing the initiative with the private sector: meet with the M-etxea architects group.  </p>
<p>- Workout with social agents: Plus +55 Association.</p>
<p>- Presentation of the project in the local Local Agenda 21, in order to include the concept of Natural Solutions in future agendas.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p>Limiting factors:</p>
<p>-Institutional or jurisdictional barriers. Lack of jurisdiction to act on the part of the local institution, as the land where a Natural Solution could be implemented falls under the jurisdiction of another agency or in private hands.</p>
<p>-Social barriers. Changes in land use can create social controversy. To avoid this, interventions must be accompanied by sound education and awareness programs.</p>

<p>Natural Solutions are characterized by their multifunctionality, that is, by having the goal of providing multiple benefits that can go far beyond the scope and objective of adaptation to climate change for which they were originally designed and for offering several collateral benefits in terms of environmental quality (in the water, noise, air and soil vectors), human health and well-being, urban regeneration capacity, improvement of habitability conditions, increase in land value, job creation, etc.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p>The Map of Natural Solutions for Local Adaptation to Climate Change has been implemented as a pilot in the Municipality of San Sebastian, in the context of its Local Adaptation Plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The results of the mapping of Natural Solutions in the context of urban planning for local adaptation to climate change have several readings and interpretations. The results must serve to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Inform decision-makers, providing a diagnosis of green capital as an input in the progress documents of Urban Planning General Plans.</p>
<p>-Likewise, inform the urban development instruments, for example, by providing design criteria for development and building in at-risk areas.</p>
<p>-Within the global scale of city’s strategy in the context of adaptation to climate change, the green solution availability map together with specific risk assessments, such as flood or temperature increases, can be valuable information when:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.55pt;">-Detecting the most anthropized zones of the municipality and which therefore may require preferential action when implementing natural solutions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.55pt;">-Defining Action Plans geared at promoting certain actions applicable to the entire municipal scope: green roofs, sustainable drainage systems, re-greening of public roads, etc.  </p>
<p style="margin-left:1.55pt;">- Formulating a strategy according to the needs of the municipality, in agreement with the city council and integrating it in the municipal public management policy, both in the general urban planning and in the developmental planning, as well as in a future Local Adaptation to Climate Change Plan.</p>
<p>- Defining a monitoring and evaluation system of the efficiency of Natural Solutions to adapt to climate change and their co-benefits before other environmental, social and economic challenges.</p>

All the models coincide in foreseeing an increase in water stress and its associated risks for this region: drought, pests, fires, as well as those related to a change in ecological conditions (extinction of species, mutualism desynchronization, alteration of biodiversity, phenological changes). Insularity is also a factor that will increase the vulnerability associated with said effects.<p></p></span></p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Fluvial Restoration of the Manzanares River in the surroundings of the Real Sitio de El Pardo (Madrid)]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p>Pursuant to the Water Framework Directive and in accordance with the environmental objectives of the Hydrological Plan of the Tagus River Hydrographic Basin, in coordination with Patrimonio Nacional (as the entity that manages the Monte de El Pardo area), the improvement of the ecological condition of the river has been proposed as well as the recovery of this space of great environmental value, from the Pardo Reservoir to the confluence with the La Trofa stream (a distance of approximately 6 km). This section coincides with Water Body ES030MSPF0428021 «Río Manzanares», which is cataloged in the Hydrological Plan as a water body that is "highly modified" from El Pardo Reservoir to the La Trofa stream.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[Fluvial restoration, Tagus River, Manzanares, Madrid]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p>The Manzanares River in the vicinity of the El Pardo Royal Site has been affected over the years by a series of hydromorphological alterations that have caused important changes in the conditions of both the riverbed and its riverbank. To the naked eye, the river appears as a succession of backwaters as a consequence of the existence of a series of different types of barriers in the channel. In particular, one of these barriers is a "pseudonatural" dam that forms at the confluence of the Manzanares River with the La Trofa stream, as a result of the accumulation of sediments (mainly sands) from the intense erosion of the basin of this stream. But these are not the only alterations that affect the basin of both channels: the Manzanares River in the study section has a hydrological regime in which, on the one hand, the circulating flow is insufficient to mobilize the sediments at the confluence with the La Trofa stream, and on the other, the lack of sediments in this flow is creating incision problems along the entire stretch and, in general, the loss of fluvial space. Furthermore, a high nutrient content has also been detected in the La Trofa stream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aforementioned alterations are very likely to become aggravated in a scenario of climate change, where a decrease of the usual flows is foreseeable as well as an increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events. If we add to this the increase in temperatures, the most immediate expected effects will be the decrease and homogenization of the aquatic biotope, the increase in the processes of incision and greater eutrophication, with the consequent development of helophytes and the decay of riparian vegetation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hence, this is why this intervention is proposed: to adapt these bodies of water and associated ecosystems to the effects of climate change, which can be simplified into three main phenomena:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The increase in temperatures will lead to a greater deterioration of the channel with the eutrophication of its waters, the increase of the existing reeds and the increase in the mortality of the riparian forest.</li>
<li>The decrease in rainfall will mean that the reservoir upstream of this stretch will have greater capacity to safeguard itself against floods, so that the downstream river will increasingly resemble a wetland with a constant flow. The absence of floods will encourage siltation of the beds and the development of vegetation within the channel.</li>
</ul><p>On the other hand, intense precipitation phenomena will have opposite effects on the La Trofa stream basin, favoring greater erosion than that which exists currently</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p>Contribute to the improvement of the ecological condition of the Manzanares River and the La Trofa stream and serve as a pilot example of a measure of adaptation to climate change in the field of ​​river management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contribute to the fulfillment of the environmental and hydrological objectives according to the current regulations (Hydrological Plan and Flood Risk Management Plan of the Tagus River Hydrographic Basin).</p>
<p>Recovery of the natural hydrological, morphological and ecological conditions of the river (permeabilization of artificial structures, recovery of riparian groves and disturbed areas).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recover the longitudinal and transversal connection of the channel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recover the accessibility to the channel, encouraging public use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bring the river closer to its users, adapting paths and trails and optimizing public and recreational spaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reduce flood risks in the area and downstream in the city of Madrid.</p>

]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p>MANZANARES RIVER</p>
<ul><li>Actions for recovery and improvement of fluvial habitat</li>
</ul><p>- Previously to the barrier permeabilization works in the Manzanares River, native fish species were rescued (capture and transfer)</p>
<p>- The number and diversity of refuge and reproductive microhabitats for aquatic organisms has increased by placing rocks and/or trunks in the river section</p>
<ul><li>Actions to improve plant cover</li>
</ul><ul><li>Silviculture work and elimination of exotic vegetation</li>
</ul><p>They include cleaning of the vegetation by pruning and clearing and, in some cases, removing the specimens that are in poor phytosanitary condition.</p>
<ul><li>Restoration of riparian vegetation</li>
</ul><p>Plantation of irregular forest of native species in bands parallel to the channel and protection of singular trees</p>
<ul><li>Recovery and improvement of hydrological continuity</li>
</ul><p>-Removal of sediments in La Trofa stream</p>
<p>The homogenization of the flow regime in the Manzanares River and the increase in erosion and discharges from several sewage treatment plants into the stream basin had created an island of sediments, which have been partially removed to ensure an adequate slope is attained for the bed to recover the original width of the river.</p>
<p>- Lowering of gauging station slab</p>
<p>The foundation slab of the Mingorrubio gauging station has been removed to lower the current bed level and eliminate the backwater generated upstream.</p>
<p>- Installation of fish ramp in the El Pardo dam to facilitate the migration of native fish species.</p>
<ul><li>Morphological recovery of the riverbank space</li>
</ul><p>- Removal of fillings and softening of slopes, improving accessibility to the river</p>
<p>- Restoration of the "Las Madroñeras - Freijo" ravine</p>
<p>The Las Madroñeras ravine is a gully complex used for the extraction of aggregates at the time of the construction of El Pardo dam.</p>
<ul><li>Sustainable public use and interpretation of nature</li>
</ul><p>- Pedestrian footbridge installation to recover pedestrian communication between both banks, which was eliminated with the demolition of the old Mingorrubio gauging station.</p>
<p>- Adaptation of different types of paths and trails</p>
<p>Those affected by earthworks have been made fit to ensure the safety of users.</p>
<p>- Interpretive material. Signage and information panels</p>
<p>Information panels have been placed that show the main natural and/or cultural characteristics of the river. In addition, the network of paths and trails has been marked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UNDERTAKINGS IN THE LA TROFA STREAM</p>
<ul><li>Zone limited to wildlife</li>
</ul><p>- Hunting enclosure</p>
<p>To minimize the causes of erosion, the area stretching from the stream crossing with the railway line to its mouth in the Manzanares River has been delimited.</p>
<p>- Drinking troughs - rafts</p>
<p>Since the enclosure results in usage restrictions of part of the stream basin, it is considered necessary to install troughs outside the enclosure.</p>
<p>- Enclosure at the confluence with the Manzanares River</p>
<p>At the point of confluence, the fence delimiting the Monte de El Pardo periodically suffers breakage due to flooding of the stream. A permanent structure has been built to withstand strong floods and allow the evacuation of large volumes of water and sand.</p>
<ul><li>Riverbed elevation and lateral reconnection</li>
</ul><p>- Installation of hydraulic elements</p>
<p>It facilitates earthworks and smoothing of slopes, which raises the bed and enhances the functionality of the floodplain, favoring the connection of vegetation with the water table.</p>
<p>The recovery of the vegetation and the natural purification of the waters coming from the municipalities of the upper part of the basin will also contribute to sediment retention.</p>
<p>- Sediment traps</p>
<p>To contribute to the stability of the materials supplied from earthworks, "fixed points" are established in the channel which, acting as a sediment trap, produce a backwater upstream.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Recovery of riparian and undergrowth vegetation</li>
</ul><p>In the band closest to the stream, deep-rooted ash trees have been planted and staked out with willows, while shrubs, scrub and trees native to the area have been planted in areas further away from the stream.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> </li>
</ul><p>High nutrient values have been detected due to effluents reaching the stream. Macrophytes with high phytodepuration potential have been planted while a biotope of interest for birds and amphibians has been generated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GENERAL UNDERTAKINGS</p>
<ul><li>Maintenance and conservation</li>
</ul><p>- Replanting</p>
<p>- Maintenance irrigation</p>
<p>- Path/trail maintenance</p>
<p>- Sanitation of riverside vegetation</p>
<ul><li>Ecological and Environmental Monitoring</li>
</ul><p>During the three subsequent years, the effect of the measures on the ecological conditions of the water body, hydromorphological conditions, state of vegetation, etc. will be evaluated. The works already carried out in this sense have allowed to design part of the undertakings to be performed in phase 2 of the project.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed, implemented and financed in part as a measure of Adaptation to Climate Change</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_interest><![CDATA[<p>It is intended that this project serve as a pilot example of a measure of adaptation to climate change through an impulse to the management of the fluvial environment.</p>
<p>As part of the Manzanares River restoration project in El Pardo (Madrid), a host of actions and some spatial planning and management guidelines were collected, in order to improve the state of the river and its surrounding environment and ensure its conservation and value.</p>
<p>Given the great potential of the Manzanares River for public use and environmental education and due to its proximity to the city of Madrid, restoration of the river is considered of great interest in the vicinity of the El Pardo Royal Site, contributing to the improvement of the ecological state of the river and the recovery of this area of ​​great environmental value.</p>
<p>In addition, in this first phase of the project, pilot actions have been incorporated on which subsequent monitoring has been established, which has allowed a first evaluation and redefinition of the actions for subsequent phases. Phase 2 is scheduled to begin in the coming months, and it has already included more widespread these pilot actions once proven effective, which can also be exported to other scenarios with similar problems.</p>

<p>-Other entities involved: "El Pardo Neighborhood Association" and "El Pardo en Común Neighborhood Association".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After drafting the project under the coordination of the General Directorate of Water and the Tagus River Hydrographic Confederation of the Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO), with the collaboration of the Spanish Office of Climate Change (MITECO), river restoration activities in this stretch of the Manzanares River began, with the goal to achieve its environmental recovery and adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding the surrounding population, several meetings have been held with the neighborhood associations to explain the projected actions and resolve doubts about its execution. During the months of March and April of 2017, a study was conducted to learn about the valuation of the Manzanares River restoration project, the valuation of the surroundings, characterization of visitors and knowing their influx and habits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A project website was created as one of the initiatives that favored the dissemination of the project, which allows to know the progress of the works and the results obtained.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A project information booth was installed next to the Somontes car park, where on weekends the public was informed about the river restoration activities that were to be carried out.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p>One of the key aspects of the project has been to improve the perception among the citizens of the problems that threaten the fluvial ecosystem and that result in those symptoms that can be seen at a glance: dry vegetation, deepening and narrowing of the channel, areas of dammed water ... The project area is one of the areas most used by locals for enjoying leisure activities. From the beginning, it has been considered that information to the population is a priority issue in order to win acceptance and achieve success of the project. To this end, several informative days have been held in the drafting phase and in the execution phase and explanatory posters have been installed. These information tasks will continue as the project progresses.</p>
<p>Another key issue is the coordination and collaboration between administrations. It is an area where the competences of various administrations converge. Achieving good coordination was one of the determining factors when it comes to realizing the project's objectives. Thanks to the involvement of all of them, the project is being executed according to plan and it is foreseen that in the next months, once the environmental processing is finished, phase 2 of the project will begin, which extends from the confluence with the La Trofa stream to the San Fernando Bridge (Madrid).</p>

    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p>This project is financed by the PIMA Adapta Plan (<em>Plan Impulso al Medio Ambiente </em>for adaptation to Climate Change in Spain), with an investment of 2,151,798.62 €.</p>
<p>The costs of this action comprise the cost of execution of the project. As for the benefits, these are derived from the improvements achieved in the manner in which the rivers function, which contribute to the objective of fulfilling the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and guaranteeing also the provision of goods and services to society, including the decrease in expected damages due to flooding and the costs allocated annually to the conservation of the public hydraulic domain, which will be significantly reduced.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p>The project is part of the Hydrological Plan of the Spanish portion of the Tagus River Hydrographic Basin. This project fulfills, among the hydromorphological measures proposed, those related to the reduction of the pressures derived from flow regulation elements thanks to the improvements in fluvial continuity and restoration it comprises.</p>
<p>In turn, this stretch of the Manzanares River is identified as one of the areas with significant potential risk of flooding. The project complies with the measures contemplated in the Flood Risk Management Plan of the Spanish portion of the Tagus River Hydrographic Basin.</p>
<p>River restoration seeks to fulfill the objectives of the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive.</p>
<p>In addition, this section is within the Special Conservation Area of ​​the "Manzanares River Basin" and is also a "Monte de El Pardo" Special Protection Area for Birds. It has a Management Plan that includes among its Natural Resource conservation Guidelines some that focus on the fluvial restoration of its water masses and the improvement of the riparian vegetation.</p>
<p>The project has been submitted for an environmental evaluation and has been the subject of a Resolution from the State Secretariat of Environment who formulates the project's Environmental Impact Report, which includes all the environmental requirements of the project. (Resolution of October 10, 2016, from the State Secretariat of Environment, which formulates the environmental impact report of the Manzanares River restoration project in the surroundings of the Real Sitio de El Pardo (Madrid) BOE nº 259 of October 26, 2016)</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[MEDACC: innovative methodologies for adaptation to climate change in the Mediterranean area]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p>The objective of the LIFE MEDACC project is to develop innovative solutions aimed at adapting our agroforestry and urban systems to the impacts of climate change in the Mediterranean area. A series of adaptation measures have been put into practice in the fields of agriculture, forest management and water management. The results of the project contribute to quantifying how adaptation can reduce the vulnerability of natural systems and human activities to climate change and assessing the economic and environmental costs associated with the application (or not) of these adaptation measures.</p>
<p>The project is carried out in three representative basins of Catalonia: the Muga, the Ter and the Segre. The goal is to ensure that results and the methodology are applicable to the design of similar experiences throughout the Mediterranean area.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Mediterranean]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p>Both forests and crops in the Mediterranean area are going to be - in fact, are already - seriously affected by climate change, in particular due to episodes of severe water scarcity and drought, combined with extended periods of very high temperatures. In the case of forests, this will aggravate the water deficit and the risk of fires and, in the case of crops, will generate increases in water demand that are unlikely to be addressed in a generalized context of water scarcity in the basins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MEDACC takes the watershed as a frame of reference. The three selected basins - those of the Muga, Ter and Segre Rivers - represent a great diversity of topographic, climatic and environmental conditions, as well as different land uses and water demands. In addition, they are subject to different stress levels impacting the water resource, which may worsen in the future. As an example, whereas in the Segre agriculture accounts for 95% of the water demand, in the Ter, urban consumption reaches 74%. In the last six decades, there are concerns over the reduction of circulating flows in the headwaters of the rivers analyzed as a consequence of the increase in temperature, the reduction of precipitation (especially in summer) and the increase in evapotranspiration. Thus, in the Segre basin, the reduction in headwater volumes is 28%, and 49% and 42-57% in the Muga and Ter Rivers, respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the forestry sphere, the project has revealed the need to intervene in Mediterranean forests that, after being subjected to a strong secular exploitation, have been abandoned in recent decades due to rural depopulation and the widespread use of fossil fuels. This has conformed very dense and immature forest masses that are, consequently, very sensitive to water stress and with a high risk of fires.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p>Different pilot initiatives have been designed, implemented and monitored to help quantify the effects (positive and negative) of the application of adaptation measures in the following sectors:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Domestic and urban water use: the project has researched the most optimal water management processes to achieve savings efficiently from the environmental, energy and social point of view;</li>
<li>Agriculture: the project sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of measures to reduce water stress linked to agricultural consumption. This includes working with different crop varieties, irrigation systems and sustainable soil management techniques;</li>
<li>Forests: pilot actions have helped to quantify the effects of forest management on forest health, water availability and fire risk.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>In addition, the impacts of climate and changes in land use and the vulnerability of the selected watersheds have been evaluated in detail.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_measures><![CDATA[Structural/physical: Technology options, Structural/physical: Ecosystemic options]]></field_measures>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p>-Overall, those areas, systems and economic sectors most sensitive to climate change were identified.</p>
<p>- A diagnosis was made to determine what adaptation measures had been previously applied to the study basins and their effects. Based on the results obtained in the modeling of socio-economic and climatic scenarios in the three watersheds studied for the 2030-2050 horizon, we have proposed which adaptation measures should be implemented in the sphere of water management. New adaptation measures have been defined and some of them have been implemented as pilot tests (agricultural and forestry).</p>
<p>-The effects of the pilot tests have been monitored in the three basins.</p>
<p>-The results have been shared in different networks and platforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is conducting field tests of the different adaptation strategies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of Mediterranean forests and crops to climate change. And, it also seeks to assess the economic and environmental costs associated with the application (or not) of the various measures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the forestry sphere, the project has revealed the need to intervene in Mediterranean forests which, after being subjected to a strong secular exploitation, have been abandoned in recent decades due to rural depopulation and the widespread use of fossil fuels. This has conformed very dense and immature forest masses that are, consequently, very sensitive to water deficits and with a high risk of fires. The proposal brought forward by LIFE MEDACC is to reduce the density of trees to accelerate the natural process of succession towards more mature forests. To do this, different treatments have been applied - clearing and thinning fundamentally - in different environmental conditions, slopes, depths of soil, etc. Thus, it has been possible to check which treatments work best in each situation and also know their costs, so as to specify afterward the appropriate management recommendations in each case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together with these specific forest management practices, evidence also exists of the need to reinforce extensive livestock farming and maintain and recover the traditional mosaic agroforestry landscapes, which are home to greater biodiversity and are less vulnerable to different impacts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding agriculture, various methods have been tried in corn and apple crops that have - at very low costs - resulted in water savings of between 20% and 30%, while maintaining production. The methodology is based on applying simple technologies to determine, as accurately as possible, the environmental conditions and weather forecasts in the different farming plots and, with these data, calculate precisely the weekly water inputs that each plot requires. This information is transmitted to farmers who can then significantly increase the efficiency of irrigation, reduce costs and contribute to improving the availability of water in the basin at the same time.</p>

The results of the project contribute to quantifying the extent to which adaptation can reduce the vulnerability of natural systems and human activities to climate change and assess the economic and environmental costs associated with the application (or not) of these adaptation measures. Thus, it is possible to check which treatments work best in each situation and also know their costs, so as to specify afterward the appropriate management recommendations in each case.</span></p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p>The Catalan Office of Climate Change has coordinated the development of the project and the work of the different participants, focusing particularly on institutional relationship tasks, liaising with the different actors of the territory and the impact of the project on Catalonia’s environmental policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Center for Ecological Research and Forest Applications (CREAF) has carried out the technical coordination of the project, placing special emphasis on the assessment of vulnerability to climate change in the study basins, the compilation and analysis of already-applied adaptation measures, the definition of new adaptation measures and the implementation of forestry pilot tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE) has been involved in the hydro-climatic modeling of the study basins and has coordinated the integration of the data collected in the project and associated results in an information platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Institute of Agri-Food Research and Technology (IRTA) has contributed its knowledge and experience in the agricultural field and has coordinated the implementation of the pilot tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Different actors of the territory - administration, academic, environmental, services and tourism, etc. - have participated in different phases of the project, contributing their knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>The results are shared in different networks and platforms, as well as in conferences, international workshops, technical seminars and agricultural tradeshows, among others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Life Shara project – <em>Awareness-raising and knowledge for adaptation to climate change</em> has showcased the initiative and actions related to adaptation to climate change of the Life Medacc project in three different formats (video interview-report, written report and panel exhibit).</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p>The MEDACC project is highlighting the need to strengthen efforts to preserve and improve the forests, especially in the headwaters of the rivers, given the enormous environmental services they provide to us in terms not only of aesthetics and recreation, but also in terms of the availability and quality of water, air quality, maintenance of biodiversity, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also reveals the urgency of implementing public policies of adaptation for agroforestry systems, which require essential improvements in the urban-rural dialogue so that society as a whole assumes the costs of keeping the rural environment alive.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p>The project budget amounts to 2,548,841€ and  has a contribution from the European Commission of 1,266,208€.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The combination of hydrological simulations and three scenarios of soil cover have revealed a strong influence of the forested surface on the generation of water flow. In some pilot tests, a seasonal increase in soil moisture has been observed where forest management activities have taken place. During spring and summer, increased soil moisture correlates favorably with the growth of trees and their health condition, as well as lower flammability and combustibility of vegetation during periods of high fire risk, and in some cases, a reduction in the rate of decay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding agriculture, various methods have been tried in corn and apple crops that have - at very low costs - resulted in water savings of between 20% and 30% while maintaining production. In the case of apple trees, the value of the production of the plot that has followed this method has been € 32,850 / ha, representing an increase of 4.2% with respect to the control plot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand, a study that is part of the project proposes allocating half of the current useful agricultural area (where crops destined for animal feed predominate) in the Alt Pirineu area (Segre River basin) to crops destined for human food, which are much better adapted to the climate change scenarios for the 2030-2050 horizon and with a greater economic return. This measure would be offset by an increase in extensive grazing, which over time has been losing ground in favor of ranching. This study concludes that the gross income of the agricultural sector in this future scenario could reach € 181.1 million, compared to the current € 84.3 million or € 76.7 million expected in the same 2030-50 scenario if the current management practices are maintained.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[EGOKI: integrating adaptation to climate change in spatial and urban planning in municipalities in Navarre]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p>The Navarre Network of Local Entities for Sustainability (NELS Network)  with the support of the Biodiversity Foundation and the Spanish Climate Change Office has developed the Project titled "EGOKI, integrating criteria for adaptation to climate change into urban planning of local entities of the Comunidad Foral de Navarra (Navarre Region)".</p>
<p>EGOKI has developed different actions, among which, agent training and  the development of pilot experiences in four municipalities that can be replicated across all of Navarre stand out. The municipalities are representative (of a rural nature and population &#60;10,000 inhabitants) and are located in different climatic zones, which means the knowledge about the climate scenarios, impacts and vulnerability and adaptation proposals considered are transferable. The conclusions have been submitted to the Government of Navarre as a proposal of technical instructions for planning and municipal guidance and help overcome the knowledge barriers that lead to inaction in the face of climate change.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p>The EGOKI Project seeks to answer questions such as: how should we plan and comprehensively manage the municipal territory to reduce its vulnerability to climate change in the urban, rural and natural environments? How can trees and green areas contribute to reduce the impact of heat waves? How will sewer networks need to be dimensioned if climate changes portend an increase in torrential rains? How can buildings be transformed to maintain thermal comfort and reduce greenhouse gas emissions?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anticipation is key, and the local scope is the ideal context for adaptation, since it is at the local scale where changes have a direct effect on the well-being and health of people and where policies can be/must be applied to favor territorial and social resilience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The inclusion of adaptation to climate change in local planning is therefore unavoidable, and is particularly relevant in urban planning:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>In urban areas, planning places constraints on aspects such as the location of activities in areas that are more or less sensitive to risks (floods, heat waves, etc.), thermal comfort of homes and facilities, water management (which is becoming increasingly critical), the environmental quality of outdoor spaces (with increasingly extreme temperatures), etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>In rural environments, from a broad concept of municipal land use management that includes rural land, planning contributes to the establishment of conditions that favor the prevention of forest fires and their possible impact on population centers, landscape protection, the promotion of organic farming and extensive livestock farming, sustainable management of forests, etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Reducing the vulnerability of municipalities in Navarre is the main objective of EGOKI, and its ultimate outcome will be a set of recommendations aimed at integrating criteria for adaptation to climate change into urban planning procedures in Navarre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is developed in small and medium size rural municipalities in terms of population (population of pilot municipalities less than 10,000) in which few adaptation experiences have taken place, particularly in the urban environment, but also in terms of the application of adaptation criteria in rural land, based on the Municipal General Planning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some relevant challenges to consider when integrating adaptation to CC in urban planning include:</p>
<p>1. Linking planning to the development model.</p>
<p>2. Urban planning with respect to the rest of the territory.</p>
<p>3. Temporary scope of planning with respect to the horizon of climate change scenarios.</p>
<p>4. Decisive content versus recommendations.</p>
<p>5. Flexibility in planning for incremental adaptation.</p>
<p>6. Coordination of municipal general planning and other municipal plans, especially Local Agenda 21 (which defines the municipal sustainability strategy) and related sectoral plans (forestry, flood, health, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La anticipación es clave y el ámbito local es el contexto idóneo para la adaptación, puesto que es en la escala local donde los cambios tienen un efecto directo sobre el bienestar y la salud de las personas y donde se pueden/deben aplicar políticas que favorezcan la resiliencia territorial y social.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La incorporación de la adaptación al cambio climático en la planificación local es por tanto ineludible, y es especialmente relevante en el planeamiento urbanístico:</p>
<ul><li>En el ámbito urbano el planeamiento condiciona aspectos como la localización de actividades en zonas más o menos sensibles a los riesgos (inundaciones, olas de calor, etc.), el confort térmico de viviendas y equipamientos, la gestión del agua (cada vez más crítica), la calidad ambiental de los espacios exteriores (con temperaturas cada vez más extremas), etc.</li>
<li>En el ámbito rural, desde un concepto amplio de ordenación del territorio municipal que incluye el suelo rústico, el planeamiento contribuye a establecer condiciones que favorecen la prevención de incendios forestales y su posible afectación a núcleos de población, la protección del paisaje, el fomento de la agricultura ecológica y la ganadería extensiva, la gestión sostenible de los bosques, etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Reducir la vulnerabilidad de los municipios navarros, es el objetivo principal de EGOKI, y su resultado final, un conjunto de recomendaciones para integrar los criterios de adaptación al cambio climático en los procedimientos de planificación urbanística en Navarra.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>El proyecto se desarrolla en municipios de carácter rural y tamaño pequeño y mediano en cuanto a población (los municipios piloto tienen menos de 10.000 habitantes) sobre los que hay escasas experiencias de adaptación, particularmente en el ámbito urbano, pero también en la aplicación de criterios de adaptación en suelo rústico desde el Plan General Municipal.</p>
<p>Algunos retos relevantes a considerar al integrar la adaptación al CC en el planeamiento urbanístico son:</p>
<p>1. Vincular el planeamiento con el modelo de desarrollo.</p>
<p>2. Ordenación urbana frente al resto del territorio.</p>
<p>3. Alcance temporal del planeamiento respecto al horizonte de los escenarios de cambio climático.</p>
<p>4. Contenido determinante frente a recomendaciones.</p>
<p>5. Flexibilidad en el planeamiento para la adaptación incremental.</p>
<p>6. Coordinación del planeamiento general municipal y otros planes municipales, especialmente la Agenda Local 21 (que define la estrategia de sostenibilidad municipal) y planes sectoriales relacionados (forestal, inundación, salud, etc.).</p>

    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p>EGOKI (which means “adapt” in Basque) contributes to achieving the objectives of the Climate Change Roadmap of Navarre (KLINA) currently in development by the Regional Government (with the participation of society as a whole) and, specifically, to prevent the vulnerability derived from the impacts of climate change at the local level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The four pilot city councils (Corella, Esteribar, Noain-Valle de Elorz and Villatuerta, which are local entities belonging to the NELS Network (Navarre Network of Local Entities for Sustainability) and are different in terms of typology and climatic sub-region) steer the task of including criteria for adaptation to climate change in their urban planning, under the supervision of experts. The remaining local entities comprising the NELS Network and in Navarre as a whole benefit from the knowledge being generated in the pilots, participation in training sessions and the push for the integration of climate change criteria into territorial and urban planning in the Region of Navarre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EGOKI is an inclusive project that is rolled out via agent theoretical and practical training, local workshops with technical planning committees, debates in municipal plenary sessions, open discussions with citizens and experience sharing. As a conclusion to this process, the NELS Network has formally submitted to the Government of Navarre a document including concrete proposals in the field of territorial and urban planning, which may be extended to the Navarre Region as a whole in the form of planning technical instructions. The Territory and Landscape Planning Service is in charge of transposing it and transferring it to all the municipalities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first activity consisted in a theoretical-practical training course for agents that has allowed to increase the overall general knowledge and kick off the work performed by teams from the four municipalities, thanks to a participatory methodology applied to pilot projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Subsequently, a supervised process was developed in which a proposal of the measures and their integration into the planning via different mechanisms were specified in each pilot, and in coordination with other municipal and sectorial plans. The teams have shared the knowledge by exchanging documents and holding joint meetings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The technical documents generated were submitted to the Town Planning Commissions of each municipality and were discussed and approved in Municipal Plenary sessions, thus guaranteeing the integration of the various measures into each of the Municipal General Plans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The methodology followed and individualized for each municipality has been developed in several phases, including: categorization of the municipal territory in relation to climate, study of climatic variability, identification of impacts and systems and sectors exposed to risks, prioritization of impact chains, vulnerability analysis and risk assessment, and characterization of adaptive measures according to the planning instrument used for their deployment, implementation and execution mechanisms and the scope and purpose of each measure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At the municipal level, some of the significant measures launched were:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>In view of the increase in temperature, Corella has planned to establish obligations or recommendations and criteria for the rehabilitation of housing, the installation of shading systems and the collection and storage of water in their Municipal Regulations and Ordinances, in addition to establishing limiting conditions and construction development criteria to ensure proper ventilation, shading, vegetation and use of low albedo materials in streets and squares.</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"> </p>
<ul><li>To tackle the risk of forest fires, Esteribar has considered classifying urban and developable land based on the presence of forest masses near urban centers, creating firebreaks following Civil Protection recommendations, duplicating access ways to vulnerable populations and regulating uses in undeveloped land to avoid activities that could cause potential fires.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>To tackle the risk of landscape degradation and the loss of biodiversity and crop yield, Noian-Valle de Elorz has included the creation of a network of green roads (linked to the environmental strategy of the Local Agenda 21), thus establishing a specific classification of suitable land, giving priority to communal land and legislatively defining the procedures for obtaining non-communal land.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>In light of the risk of fluvial floods, Villatuerta has considered different undertakings on the Iranzu River channel crossing the town and the channels feeding it, including the declassification of developable land in flood areas to create natural zones of relief and the establishment of mechanisms for obtaining land (swaps and expropriations), as well as the creation of a regulation pond through a Special Plan for Non-Developable Land.</li>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_interest><![CDATA[<p>Urban planning at the municipal level has a significant potential for adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is developed in small municipalities (population less than 10,000) in which few adaptation experiences have taken place in the urban environment as well as in terms of the contribution from the Municipal General Plan to include criteria for adaptation to climate change in rural and natural areas (rural land management).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Likewise, the development of pilot initiatives allows to verify the results of the actions and achieve greater diffusion for replication in other municipalities with similar characteristics. On the other hand, the approach of the project as a participatory process that takes into account all the agents involved favors an enhanced ownership of the adaptive measures being adopted, making proposals sustainable over time.</p>
]]></field_interest>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p>The EGOKI Project is an initiative of the Navarre Network of Local Entities for Sustainability (NELS Network) and has the support from the Government of Navarre (through the General Directorate of Environment and Territorial Planning) with the collaboration of Lursarea-Navarra Territory and Sustainability Agency (integrated in the public company Nasuvinsa). The municipalities of Corella, Esteribar, Noain-Valle de Elorz and Villatuerta develop the pilot experiences and contribute to finance the project. All these entities have signed a collaboration agreement at the beginning of the project to confirm their commitment to work together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These four municipalities have piloted the work of including criteria for adaptation to climate change in their urban planning reviews, with the supervision of experts (and advice from Tecnalia Research &#38; Innovation). The remaining local entities that make up the NELS Network benefit from the knowledge generated during the pilot experiences, as well as from participation in training sessions and the promotion to include climate change criteria in territorial and urban planning in the Region of Navarre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lursarea and the Government of Navarre provide technical and logistical support to the project and the NELS Network. Lursarea has contributed to the design of the project and has provided accommodation and offered technical support to the project coordinator. Furthermore, the Government of Navarre, which currently assumes the Technical Secretariat of the NELS Network (through which it supports the project), has overseen the technical aspects of the process from the Territory and Landscape Management Service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project has the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment, through the Biodiversity Foundation, and has received financing approval in the Call for aid granted by the Biodiversity Foundation, on a competitive basis, for the realization of projects in the field of adaptation to climate change in 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The EGOKI project has been developed following a participatory scheme by means of technical training courses and the different participating agents, local workshops, debates in municipal plenary sessions and talks open to the public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The different actions addressing the different audiences (in addition to the technical teams of each of the pilot municipalities), such as the training course and the final technical seminar, have been disseminated via email and social networks of the NELS NETWORK (Facebook and Twitter), as well as through press releases published on the website of the Government of Navarre.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p>The process was completed in June 2018 with the submittal of a document by the NELS Network to the Government of Navarra containing specific proposals in the field of spatial and urban planning, which may be extended to the entire Region, in the form of Planning Criteria or Technical Instructions, according to the transposition made by the Territory and Landscape Planning Service. The fact that the four pilot municipalities are representative of most of the municipalities in Navarre and are located in the four main climatic sub-regions identified in Navarre guarantees the transferability of the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the process, minor inconveniences have arisen which, nonetheless, have not prevented completing the actions according to plan and successfully achieving the objectives. In particular, agents participating in the training course have experienced initial difficulties (including the municipal work teams) when trying to assimilate novel concepts and technical aspects related to climate adaptation in connection with urban planning, as well as difficulties in matching the pace and quality of the work of the different municipal teams at certain times. (In Navarre, most small municipalities do not have specific technical specialists and the planning drafting teams have had different time availability).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the political and technical commitment of the four pilot councils with EGOKI has been firm and, despite the difficulties that have arisen at certain moments, they have provided solutions and given priority to the project. This, together with the collaborative work scheme and the equally firm commitment of the group of entities that have signed the agreement, has been the main success factor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding the execution of the specific work of including adaptation criteria in the planning, it should be noted that, being a novel subject, the different technical specialists have addressed the work in different ways, making the task of compiling the conclusions into a common document that should guide the future work of all Navarre municipalities complex.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Verifying the fact that the best way to advance in knowledge is learning by doing and sharing and comparing that which is being worked on has been a positive experience, thus proving that the foreseen methodology has turned out to be strongly valid. Having different teams working simultaneously and mutually supporting one another has been fundamental, as it has facilitated motivating the technical specialists at all times and kept them from becoming discouraged due to lack of confidence in their capacity to tackle such a novel task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the process, useful data sources have been identified as well as certain information gaps and specific studies that are needed to further determine the climatic scenarios, dangers, vulnerability and the adaptive capacity of different systems and specific sectors. From this angle, the process has also been useful to identify the available and unavailable information that might be necessary for integrating climate adaptation into spatial and urban planning and transferring the need to carry out studies, collect indicators, etc. on a local scale to the Government of Navarre and Lursarea. The positive aspect is related to the absence of accurate information, which has allowed enhancing the technical specialists’ analytical capabilities and decision-making skills at their discretion (expert judgment).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The close collaboration among all signatory entities of the agreement and the inclusion of the Navarre Delegation of the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet) is again worth noting, which has also contributed to the project in the form of training and advisory initiatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of the above has highlighted EGOKI as a project that facilitates coordination between public administrations and entities related to climate change, favoring the development of the Climate Change Roadmap of Navarre (KLINA).</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p>The total budget of the project amounts to € 54,365 (euros). Funding is public and comes from different administrations (state, regional and local).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project has the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment, through the Biodiversity Foundation, and has received financing approval in the Call for aid granted by the Biodiversity Foundation, on a competitive basis, for the realization of projects in the field of adaptation to climate change in 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Biodiversity Foundation finances 70% of the budget, representing an aid of € 38,055 (euros). Thirty percent,  € 16,310 (euros) is funded by the NELS Network (€ 13,310) and by the pilot town councils (€ 750 each).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both the Government of Navarre and Lursarea-Navarre Territory and Sustainability Agency (integrated in the public company Nasuvinsa) collaborate in the project, providing support to the coordinator as follows: the Government provides support through the NELS Network Technical Secretariat, with follow-up by the Territory and Landscape Planning Service; Lursarea, contributes to the design of the project and provides accommodation and technical support to the coordinator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project has been successfully completed: participating agents in Navarre have been trained in spatial planning and urban planning. The four pilot municipalities have completed the process and the conclusions of their work are transferable to the whole of Navarre. The involvement of the work teams (municipal technical specialists and planning drafting teams) has been instrumental. Training of the planning drafting teams in this field is considered key in order to expand the inclusion of criteria for adaptation to climate change in other Municipal General Plans and planning at different scales (there are few city planners working in Navarre and all of them work in different municipalities simultaneously).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The EGOKI project has been a forerunner to the establishment of an adaptive planning and management of both the territory and the built environment in Navarre, the continuity of which is guaranteed thanks to agent training, the development of Urban Planning Criteria or Technical Instructions and coordination of this work with the development of the Climate Change Roadmap of Navarre (KLINA) and the LIFE Integrated NADAPTA project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EGOKI brings high efficiency from a cost-benefit standpoint, since it has been capable to achieve very good results with a modest budget that will be sustained and increased over time.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Social vulnerability to heatwaves – from assessment to implementation of adaptation measures in Košice and Trnava, Slovakia]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">High temperatures and heatwaves in the summer pose increasing risks to people living in Slovakian cities. In particular older people and children, those living on top floors in poorly insulated buildings, and those relying on facilities such as nurseries, schools or care homes are prone to heat stress. The Carpathian Development Institute, in collaboration with local authorities in Trnava and Košice, carried out an assessment of vulnerability to high temperatures and heatwaves in residential environment, taking into account the social aspects. Factors such as presence of older people, children and location of facilities serving these vulnerable groups were considered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the results of the assessment, adaptation strategies are being implemented in both Trnava and Košice, including measures such as thickening of tree stands in parks, building and restoration of water elements (blue infrastructure) and fountains in most vulnerable places, actions aiming at changing citizen behavior during heatwaves, etc., Moreover, a neglected public open space in a vulnerable area in Trnava was redesigned to provide shading through planting of trees and other vegetation.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Trnava and Košice face increasing temperatures. In Košice, ten hottest years in the last 150 years have occurred since 1990, and the annual mean temperature between 1881 and 2100 has increased by 1.6°C. Number of tropical days (mean temperature above 30 °C) has increased in the last 20 years from 12 to 20 days (in the year 2012 it was 37 days) and the maximum temperature frequently exceeds 34°C. Similarly, in Trnava, summers are getting hotter and winters are getting warmer (although the winter temperatures are increasing at a slower rate than summer temperatures). The annual number of summer days (mean temperature above 25 °C) is projected to rise from 58 (1961–1990) to 100 (2051–2100). The annual number of tropical days will rise from 12 to 36 in the same periods. Both cities are likely to be affected by longer and more severe droughts in the future. Whilst in Trnava the precipitation is slightly decreasing (more substantially in winter), in Košice the total amount of precipitation remains steady, whilst there are more torrential rains possibly causing flooding interspersed with dry periods.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Trnava (population of about 68,000 inhabitants) is extremely vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, due to its historical character associated with high proportion of paved surfaces, which exacerbate heat stress during periods of high temperature. In Košice (population of about 240,000 inhabitants), large proportion of residents are living in prefabricated blocks of flats, prone to overheating in high temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Carpathian Development Institute, in collaboration with local authorities, carried out an assessment of vulnerability to high temperatures of the entire city of Trnava and the densely populated and materially deprived Zapad district (40,000 inhabitants) in Košice. The assessment was a basis for the development of a range of actions aiming to improve the adaptation capacity of Trnava and Košice to climate change and heatwaves in particular.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Košice, the Mayor of the self-governed city borough of Zapad decided to prepare a climate change adaptation plan. Zapad is a relatively homogenous residential area, consisting of mainly blocks of flats constructed from prefabricated elements and poorly insulated. Despite the high density of population, there is a considerable amount of green space between the apartment blocks, making it the greenest part of Košice city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, a vulnerability assessment was carried out by the Carpathian Development Institute. The following vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity indicators were collected and analysed for 200m x 200m grid cells to identify hotspots of vulnerability and risk in relation to heatwaves:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Percentage of people over the age of 75 and below 4 years;</li>
<li>Percentage of people living in top-floor flats;</li>
<li>Location of vulnerable facilities (e.g. nurseries, kindergartens, care homes for the elderly);</li>
<li>Level of thermal insulation of prefabricated apartment blocks;</li>
<li>Extent of paved areas with no shade;</li>
<li>Coverage of green areas, and in particular availability of green areas with a tree crowns coverage over 60% and with surface over 2 ha (considered as the most effective in cooling);</li>
<li>Surface roughness (height and orientation of buildings);</li>
<li>Temperature distribution pattern (based on measurements during heatwaves);</li>
<li>Circulation of cooling air and katabatic wind (i.e. downslope, cool wind);</li>
<li>Presence of air conditioning on the city transport;</li>
<li>Availability of medical assistance during heatwaves.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, a survey was carried out with the local citizens on the awareness of heatwaves, knowledge of behaviours reducing heat stress risk, perceived need for adaptation planning in their area as well as on the preferred adaptation measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All factors were weighted considering their influence on the risk of high temperatures to human health, based on scientific literature, and presented on maps. The combination of all factors produced the overall vulnerability map of the Zapad borough. The analysis allowed the identification of areas that are particularly vulnerable from the social perspective and exposed to high temperatures. The results, combined with the outcome of the survey, informed a local government-led strategy including the implementation of the following types of actions:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Improved shading through vegetation and artificial structures.</li>
<li>Cooling of existing public spaces, including: increase of green areas, revitalization of existing parks and green areas, use of climate-resilient tree species, reduction of sealed surfaces, building and restoration of elements of blue infrastructure and water fountains. Among the various interventions, thickness of green stands in parks has been improved, aiming at 60% coverage of tree canopy.</li>
<li>Cooling of indoor public spaces, including: improved thermal insulation, vertical greenery, shading of transparent openings, windows and displays, green/reflecting roofs, some use of air conditioning in most vulnerable facilities.</li>
<li>Early warning system on heatwaves, developed in cooperation with the State Health Authority of Slovakia.</li>
<li>Information and educational activities for citizens related to safe behavior during heatwaves.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Another action included in the local strategy was the establishment of a ‘climate-correct decision-making’ programme, i.e. building capacity of public administration; introduction of mechanisms ensuring that climate concerns are taken into account in planning and issuing of construction permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Trnava, a similar approach to vulnerability assessment was taken, and similar range of adaptation measures was developed in the climate adaptation plan. Moreover, a former neglected open space neighboring a block of flats, kindergarten and care home for the elderly (thus identified as a location highly vulnerable to heatwaves) was transformed through removal of tarmac, planting of trees (to achieve 60% crown coverage once the trees mature), construction of a fountain, and provision of new benches. This resulted in an inviting green space offering respite during heatwaves, which is also being used for socialising by the local community. In addition, sustainable urban drainage systems were introduced to improve water infiltration and retention. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures is planned 5 years after completion of the project in 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the city scale, Trnava also encourages citizen engagement in adaptation through setting up of a municipal budget (minimum 10,000 euro a year) for adaptation grant applications. The adaptation measures can be proposed by either individuals or organisations and a detailed set of criteria ensures that they are in line with the city adaptation plan. To date, mainly awareness-raising activities at local schools are being supported.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Trnava is one of the first cities in Slovakia with systematic approach to climate change impacts. The adaptation plan will serve not only as a tool to tackle heatwaves and urban heat island effect; it is also considered a prerequisite for drawing external resources from EU in the funding period 2014–2020.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The vulnerability assessment supporting the identification and implementation of adaptation measures was carried out by the Carpathian Development Institute, which developed the methodology and provided the expert leadership for the project. In Košice, the Mayor of the Zapad borough provided political support for the project and the civil servants provided the necessary data. Additional expertise was provided by the Slovak Hydro-meteorological Institute and the Regional Office of Public Health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local authorities were closely involved in the vulnerability assessment in both cities. The development of the adaptation strategies (for 10-15 years) and the adaptation action plans (for 3 years, with concrete adaptation measures and allocated responsibilities and finance) was a collaborative effort between the Carpathian Development Institute and local authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the project in Košice, local citizens were consulted (through a survey) on their perceived need for the adaptation planning in their area, as well as on the preferred type of adaptation measures. The planning and implementation of the pilot greening project in Trnava was carried out by the local authority, but the idea was consulted with the district committee including local residents. Moreover, in Trnava, the citizens and local organisations can propose adaptation measures to be funded by the city through a participatory budget mechanism.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Slovakia is currently revising its National Adaptation Strategy, but has not developed a national adaptation action plan yet; the initiative in Košice and Trnava was carried out in the absence of national regulations. Therefore, there is little support on adaptation for local authorities from the national level. Alongside Trnava and the Zapad borough of Košice, only Bratislava and Kezmarok have developed adaptation plans to date. Therefore, overall, there is a limited willingness of the local authorities to invest their resources into the systematic adaptation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the city level, other limitations are associated with the local authority officials, being overwhelmed by their day-today activities. Also the novelty of the climate adaptation topic and its multispectral character make it a difficult subject to tackle by representatives of local authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major success factors was strong commitment from the city leadership. In Košice, a strong enabling factor was the support from the local Mayor interested in the adaptation agenda. In Trnava, the interest of the local government officials in climate change and the willingness to learn drove their participation in the international conference <em>Climate Change and Local Development – Challenge for Local Governments</em> (March 2012, Bratislava). Following the event, the representatives of Trnava City actively looked for support in development of their adaptation action plan. The solution was found in the joint project led by Carpathian Development Institute dealing with the assessment of vulnerability to high temperatures and heatwaves. The collaborative nature of the project was one of the success factors. The availability of external funding was also crucial in completion of the vulnerability assessment and development of the climate change adaptation plans.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Košice, funding for the development of the Zapad Adaptation Strategy was provided through the project “Climcross Development: Partnership for addressing climate change impacts on development” run within the Hungary-Slovakia Cross-border Co-operation Programme 2007–2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Trnava, funding was provided by the project “Cities resilient to Climate Change Impacts” inspired by city of Trnava, which was funded via Swiss Financial Mechanism (SFM). The SFM financed mainly the development of the Adaptation Strategy, but 20,000 euros were provided for tree seedlings, which were planted and are being maintained by the Trnava city. The grant/participatory budget scheme aiming to support small-scale adaptation measures  (minimum 10,000 euro a year) is financed from the city budget.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no legal framework in Slovakia specifically supporting urban adaptation to climate change. The main strategic document of reference is the Slovak National Adaptation Strategy, adopted by the Government in 2014. Trnava is a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy since 2016, with an adaptation target.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Trnava, the vulnerability assessment and the development of the adaptation action plan were carried out in 2013-2015. The vulnerability assessment and the elaboration of adaptation strategy in Košice took 13 months, from early 2013 to mid-2014. The various adaptation measures are progressively implemented.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[A flood and heat proof green Emscher valley, Germany]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a century ago a sparsely populated landscape of water meadows was transformed into an industrial conurbation, and the untamed river Emscher turned into a man-made system of open waste waterways. Due to ongoing subsidence caused by mining, it was impossible to build an underground sewer system. Therefore, the Emscher and its tributaries were regulated and used to transport the wastewater together with rainwater on the surface. This made the Emscher simply a great open wastewater channel. With the decline in the mining industry, traditional heavy industry gave way to the services and high-tech industries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1990s restoration of the 82 km stretch of river in a catchment of 865 square kilometres began, gradually creating the New Emscher Valley taking into account challenges of climate change. In future, wastewater will be channelled through closed sewers and the river and its tributaries will be converted into nature-like waterways. Gradually being developed, the valley will comprise cooling green spaces, areas for flood control, recreation areas and a habitat network, therefore enhancing quality of life in the Ruhr metropolitan area under future climate conditions. Taking an integrated and holistic approach, by strengthening the green infrastructure network and changing the water management, the Emscher Valley will have an improved capacity as carbon sink, a more favourable microclimate, reduced flood risks in case of heavy rainfall events and a more balanced water cycle in times of dry summer periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During the 20th century the Emscher was used mainly to quickly and completely drain all the area’s wastewater. This resulted in extreme fluctuations in the amounts of water discharged. Following a downpour, up to 350 cubic meters per second of water would flow through the Emscher, in contrast during dry periods just 11 cubic meters per second of water would trickle through this polluted waterway. Considering climate change projection more extremes can be expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, according to long-range climate projections, the Emscher area will develop more wet and moderate winters, along with more frequent extreme winds and storms. Summers will be hot and with recurring events of extreme rainfall. These climatic changes will leave lasting effects upon the socio-economic conditions of the population, upon security, and upon the region’s productivity and competitiveness. More in detail, the following climate change challenges are expected for the area:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Increase of extreme rainfall events: more often and more severe. Climate change will double the events of extreme rainfall. Data from 1961-1990 show rainfall events with more than 40 mm/d to occur about 2 times per year. The projections for similar events for the years 2021-2015 is about 5 times per year and for the years 2071-2100 even more than 5 times. The annual mean precipitation will increase by about 9% by 2050. Together with rising temperature the rainfall events will become more severe, because the warmer atmosphere can accumulate more humidity.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase of temperature: more hot days, less cold days. Ove the recent 50 years, the average air temperature has shown an increase of 1°C. For the future, the annual mean temperature is expected to increase of another 1,6 degrees by 2050, and about 2,9 degrees by 2100. Not only will the average temperature rise, also extremes will be more common with more days with temperatures higher than 30 degrees. By 2050, 50% more hot days, and by 2100 about 100% more hot days are expected to occur. This will cause heat stress, especially for the aging human population in the Ruhr area. Cold days with frost and ice will decrease by about 50% by 2050 and by about 80% by 2100.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Impacts on ground water: less in summer and higher in winter. In summer, higher temperatures are expected to result in a lower ground water recharge rate. In winter, with more precipitation, the level of ground water is expected to rise. This will increase the possibility of floods. Specifically, if no sustainable storm water management is implemented, the areas with flood risk will increase by about 20% in the close future.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Impacts on ecosystems. The above described climate changes will have impacts on ecosystem such as water bodies, wetlands and woodlands. Especially water bodies are sensitive: low water levels in summer will raise the level of nutrients and pollutants, extreme rainfall will cause erosion at the river banks and a higher temperature will lower the level of oxygen in water.</li>
</ul>]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare for future climatic conditions, a traditional approach would make use of grey engineering with technical solutions such as building higher dikes and bigger sewers or enhancement of pumping stations. The Emschergenossenschaft, the water management association responsible for Emscher, has decided for a more flexible nature-based solution. Choice was made for combining the channelling of the wastewater from the Emscher and its tributaries into closed sewers, with revitalization of the rivers aiming to strengthen the water cycle and profit from the water buffering as well as from cooling provided by nature’s ecosystem services. In short, the main adaptation objectives are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">For summer: creating the green corridors of the Emscher landscape park for cooling, as well as creating a resilient water system thereby avoiding the drying-out of brooks and rivers.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For winter: increasing the retention capacity of the water bodies in order to avoid flooding in case of heavy rainfalls.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A traditional solution in response to the expected water discharge needs would be the construction of a sewer system that can cope with expected variation in water amounts. With the Emscher project a more transitional approach was taken strengthening the water cycle by converting the river and its tributaries into nature-like waterways and by having waste water channelled through closed sewers. Gradually being developed, the valley will comprise cooling green spaces, areas for flood control, recreation areas and a habitat network, therefore enhancing quality of life in the Ruhr metropolitan. Nature-like water bodies have a higher capacity to buffer extreme weather events. In case of heavy rainfall, a nature-like water body has a 10% higher retention capacity than a heavily modified water body. The green belts accompanying the Emscher and its tributaries work as fresh air supply corridors for the dense urban areas. Wetlands and areas for storm water retention cool down heat islands. The living quality for people rises, heat stress is reduced, and new cycle paths along the water bodies provide possibilities for sustainable mobility. The overall approach taken is to integrate water management and urban planning for a water sensitive urban development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before projects such as dynaklim and Future Cities started, each actor in the Emscher region developed its own adaptation strategy. For example, the water boards analysed whether their sustainable water management was fit to cope with expected impacts of climate change. Cities assessed their building stock and discussed which improvements would be needed in response to the heat island effect. Further, the Regional Association Ruhr (Regionalverband Ruhr) fostered their measurements of urban temperatures. With the support of these two projects a cross-sectoral approach was developed, including all relevant stakeholders such as: water management, planning, building, health sector and emergency service ones. For example, in addressing climate change and the future availability of water, the dynaklim network elaborated a “Roadmap 2020”. This roadmap is a cross-sectoral framework of reference for a future, regional adaptation strategy that coordinates goals and activities of regional administration, politics, economy and society, identifies and coordinates priorities with relevant regional actors and structures them in terms of timing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, being a partner in the Future Cities project, the Emscher case served as an example to develop strategies to make city regions fit to cope with the expected impacts of climate change. Within the project the joint tool “Future Cities Adaptation Compass” was developed to help city regions to create their own adaptation strategy. This tool fostered very much an interdisciplinary approach to reach cross-sectoral solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of an outcome of the Future Cities project is the sustainable development of two climate-proof industrial parks in Bottrop, in the Emscher region. Flash floods after heavy rainfalls often occurred on both sites. This situation is expected to be intensified with climate change. The Emschergenossenschaft and the Bottrop municipality agreed on a cooperation to restructure the industrial parks "Scharnhölzstraße" and "Boytal", thereby combining water, green and energy measures to make them climate-proof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Scharnhölzstraße” is an old business-site with almost completely sealed surface. On the site, heavy rains tend to cause problems as well as overheating during periods of drought. A combined approach was taken for the public space on the one hand and the privately owned premises of the industry on the other hand. Decentralized solutions for rainwater (rainwater infiltration and rainwater use, solar power usage and green-zone enrichment) were envisaged to strengthen the area for upcoming climate events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The industrial park “Boytal” drained the rainwater into an open ditch which ended in a nearby lake. There was no existing overflow from the lake into a natural body but only into the mixed sewer system. The aim is to disconnect the whole industrial park from the system. As this will take place in the context of the ecological transformation of the river Boye, a new blue-green corridor will be realised in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the Emscher system is already well prepared, torrential rainfall events will still cause severe flooding from time to time. Therefore, it remains necessary to plan and implement rainwater retention to improve preparedness. One example has been the planning and construction of Lake Phönix in Dortmund (supported by funding within the Urban Water project) which will be able to absorb up to 240,000 cubic meter of floodwater from the river Emscher. Another example for reducing high water flows is the goal that has been set with the “Future Convention for Stormwater” of reducing inflows of rainwater and clean water into the waste water system by 15 percent within 15 years, from 2005 to 2020.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The dynaklim group, established within the dynaklim project, includes more than 50 network partners: companies involved in the regional economy, water boards, municipalities, universities and research facilities, as well as regional and civil society initiatives. Together, they have drawn up a joint regional climate adaptation strategy. The dynaklim network has set up a constant exchange of new knowledge and practical experiences between the project partners and with the public. The design of the network and strategy is meant to ensure that once the adaptation process has been initiated and the funding has stopped it will nevertheless be continued by the region on a self-sustaining basis. Similarly, several actions were defined during the Future Cities project and were set-up with the aim to see continuation after the ending of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of initiatives were initiated to ensure durability to the above projects, possibly including stakeholder engagement:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The former annual meetings of the dynaklim project are continued by the DWA (Deutschen Vereinigung für Wasserwirtschaft, Abwasser und Abfalland) project partners.</li>
<li>Some measures were integrated in the “Klimaschutzplan” in the dynaklim project, an adaptation regulation of the North Rhine-Westphalian government.</li>
<li>The dynaklim Roadmap 2020 entitles the responsible organisations for the adaptation process and stipulates the organisations realised during the project stage to continue the needed actions.</li>
<li>The use of the Future Cities Adaptation Compass in the city of Dortmund includes wide stakeholder participation. The process started with a stakeholder analyses to make sure that no relevant actor is left out.</li>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">After more than 20 years of planning and implementation, the New Emscher Valley has gone from a purely envisioned ideal to a reality that has inspired new urban development. The modernisation of wastewater infrastructure and associated revitalisation of the Emscher are making the river a valuable space for leisure and relaxation in the region. An integrated perspective on nature and technology shows that the Emscher can be perceived as far more than just an ecosystem. People can now again experience the Emscher, which was once inaccessible to the public due to high levels of pollution. The revitalisation of the Emscher and discharge of wastewater into underground canals has freed up new spaces for innovation above ground, making the Emscher region more attractive. Ecological, social and institutional innovation will be needed to develop these new spaces. Hence, the Emscher conversion is not only a technological project but also framed as an important trigger for notably improving the quality of life and achieving positive economic impacts in the Ruhr area. By reusing and preserving the impressive relics of the industrial era, the Ruhr region has been able to keep its unique identity and has re-branded itself as an ancient monument of industrial society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main limiting factor is space. In a densely populated region such as the Emscher region with 2.700 people per square kilometre it is very hard to find space for a meandering river system. The competing demands on space are manifold: economic, social and ecological aspects have to be weighed up against each other. In addition, public authorities can only approve plans based on valid regulations. However, there are no rules that specify dimensions of sewers or dikes with uncertain increases of rainfall for the next 50-100 years.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With an investment volume of 4.5 billion Euros and a project period of several decades, i.e. from 1989 (start of the International Building Exhibition IBA Emscherpark) to 2020, the Emscher conversion is one of Europe’s biggest infrastructure projects. Investments of this size have noticeable impact on a region’s economy. Through the Emscher revitalisation about 1400 jobs per year are created in the years from 1991 to 2020 (cf. study from Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, November 2013). The conversion project’s significance extends well beyond its direct effects on employment though. Upgrading the Emscher region will provide a new quality of life and work and bring with it great opportunities to sustainably improve the Ruhr area’s attractiveness. Thus, it will influence positively the decisions of innovation-oriented companies considering moving or starting up in the region. The successful conversion of such a large river system also sends a positive signal for similar large-scale water management and urban development projects throughout Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the challenges of climate adaptation, it is hardly possible to name the costs involved if choice would not have been made to restore the Emscher but to implement higher dikes and bigger sewers. In addition to that it would cost a fortune to provide a purely technical protection system, this would never be 100% proof considering that no-one knows exactly how extreme the next rainfall event will be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Emscher Landscape Park was mainly funded by the State Government of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), especially from the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Urban Development. In addition to the state support, co-financing of EU money especially through objective 2-funding made up part of the financing structure. During the period of the IBA (International Building Exhibition), there were extra funding options; the funding programme ÖPEL (Ökologieprogramm Emscher Lippe) was set up, which still exists today. The Emscher revitalisation is paid through the members of the Emschergenossenschaft, which are municipalities, the mining industry and private parties. Further, best use has been made of several funds: from the federal land NRW, national funding such as KLIMZUG, and EU-funding such as objective 2, INTERREG, FP7 and HORIZON2020, LIFE+. Wherever possible, support from private parties, local businesses and NGOs such as the Emscherfreunde is welcomed.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Four pillars to Hamburg’s Green Roof Strategy: financial incentive, dialogue, regulation and science]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In response to climate change, one of Hamburg’s objectives is to become greener, in the city and on the roofs. In this context, Hamburg is the first German city to have developed a comprehensive Green Roof Strategy. The goal is to plant a total of 100 hectares of green roof surface in the metropolitan area in the next decade. The Hamburg Ministry for Environment and Energy is providing financial support for the creation of green roofs to the sum of € 3 million until the end of 2019. Building owners can receive subsidies to cover up to 60% of installation costs. Additional benefit stems from lower maintenance costs due to the longer lifetime of green roofs, lower energy costs because of improved building insulation and a 50% reduction on rain water fees thanks to the rain water retention function of green roofs.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Northern Germany, depending on the scenario considered, scientists forecast an average temperature rise of 2.8° to 4.7° Celsius by the end of the century. Through the urban heat island effect, an amount of up to 5° Celsius needs to be added to this average increase when considering temperature rise in urban areas. Long term temperature data demonstrate that in 2013 the average annual temperature in Hamburg was 9° Celsius, 1.2° Celsius more than it was 60 years ago. For Northern Germany, there will probably not be more rainfall in the future, but there will be a change in its distribution over the year. The overall amount of precipitation in the region could increase by 40% in winter, while from newest research summer rains may increase, remain as today or decrease by the same amount. Northern Germany will likely also suffer more frequently from extreme weather situations, such as dry summers with extreme heat periods and locally heavy cloudbursts, and high precipitation levels in winter with severe storms. These changes are already seen today. Green roofs can provide part of a solution to these projected climate change impacts by mitigating increased temperature and extreme rainfall events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburg is also affected in other ways by climate change. These cannot be addressed by the Green Roof Strategy. Specifically, the city is to be affected both by rising storm surges (floods) from the North Sea and by higher levels of the River Elbe, the latter due to rain and snow melt from inland. Further, a rise in sea level would also have an impact on water levels of the Elbe, and carry increased amounts of sediment into the port and urban river stretches. Compared to 60 years ago, the sea level in the port city has risen by 20 centimetres. It is forecasted that storm surges could result in a further rise by another 30 to 110 centimetres by 2100.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburg has a growing number of residents leading to an urban expansion policy requiring a great number of additional housing. To maintain Hamburg’s compact urban structure the objective is to improve the quality (rather than the quantity) of open green city spaces. In this context, Hamburg’s objective is to be greener – on top. The goal is to plant a total of 100 hectares of green roof surface with plants and flowers in the metropolitan area by 2020, the equivalent of double the surface of ‘Planten un Blomen’ city park (45 hectares). New residential constructions alone provide a 44 hectare green roof potential over 5 years, new business constructions provide an additional potential of 66 hectares. The city’s ambition is to have 20% of the green roofs on new buildings to be made available to residents or employees for recreation, in the form of sports fields and parks, or as gardens in shared use by the housing community. By promoting green roofs, the city aims to encourage space efficient leisure areas, improve the city’s rainwater retention capacity, increase biodiversity and reduce extreme temperature effects (c.f. reduction of the heat island effect).</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburg is a constantly growing city, demonstrating that the creation of new living space and green awareness can be compatible. The city’s environment strategy as stated in the Climate Plan of 2016 addresses the effects of climate change such as increase in heavy rains, flooding and heat waves. Green roofs in this context improve both the city climate and water management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With respect to the city’s climate, green roofs cool the surrounding and increase humidity, which reduces the urban heat island effect. Also, green roofs provide improved insolation to buildings and therefore better adaptation to more extreme temperatures. Further, greened roofs improve water management through rain water retention and natural evaporation. They retain between 40 and 90% of rain water. Most of the water evaporates and returns directly to the natural water cycle. This in turn eases the burden on the sewage system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Roof Strategy therefore complements the city’s RISA (Rain InfraStructure Adaptation 2030) project. RISA is the city’s strategy for the sustainable management of rainwater. Less water can be drained away in the increasingly dense city while heavier rainfalls as a result of climate change are becoming more frequent. As a consequence the sewage system is overloaded and rivers are bursting their banks. This has made ‘Hamburg Wasser’, the city’s water utility, to impose strict restrictions on water discharge per house and time. This strict allowance implies that excess rainwater should be temporarily retained to avoid an overload of the sewage system. Calculations show that on average 60% of rainwater has to be retained to avoid a sewage overload. Dealing with stormwater in Hamburg is a cross-disciplinary and cross-administrative objective and recommendations are contained in the document ‘Structure Plan Rainwater 2030’, which was released in 2016. Hamburg’s green roofs can contribute to relieving the drainage infrastructure by reducing the total amount of rainwater run-off and slowing down the speed of the remaining run-off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Green roofs also clear the air by absorbing dust and harmful substances. Further, green roofs offer space for recreation in the densely populated city centre opening up new spaces. The city explains that companies and landlords will have a clear competitive advantage with a green roof. These new green spaces right in the middle of the city are particularly attractive to residents and employees. They can relax, do sports, or plant vegetables and flowers. In order to succeed with the Green Roof Strategy the city combines promotion, dialogue, policy and research:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Promotion: with an incentive programme the city is providing subsidies until 2020 for each owner (private or public) voluntarily deciding for a green roof. The subsidy will be paid both for refurbishing the roof as well as green roofs in new buildings.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Communication and dialogue: the incentive programme is communicated strongly with a city-wide awareness campaign “On Your Roofs, Get Set, Green!”. Using posters, brochures, press articles and internet promotion, the green roof benefits are shared with Hamburg inhabitants and visitors. The greening of public roofs is an excellent promotional example. A full-time communication officer in the Hamburg Ministry of Environment and Energy is in charge of all communication actions. A dialogue is necessary with local politicians, authorities, architects, engineers and economists.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Policy and regulation: embed the Green Roof Strategy in urban landscape planning. The Strategy aims to incorporate or enhance green roofs into legally binding instruments such as the Hamburg Building law, the wastewater law, planting regulations on structural systems and land-use plans.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Scientific support: the HafenCity university is providing scientific support to the Green Roof Strategy. Scientists at the university are evaluating international findings on green roofs, developing their own recommendations for Hamburg’s green roof construction, and collecting data on water retention and the water management effectiveness of green roofs especially with severe cloudbursts (the latter to convince sceptics that question the green roof’s water retention capacities of large roofs). In fact, the city of Hamburg and the HafenCity university want to develop guidance for the promotion of green roofs which other cities can then use to create their own measures for climate change adaptation. The scientific work is partly funded by the federal government of Germany as a part of the “Measures to Adapt to Climate Change” project.</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburg is using a wide range of networks and cooperation with other cities to present itself as a climate action centre at regional, national, European and international level. The experience gained in this process is used in its own response to climate change. When developing the incentive programme for green roofs, Hamburg involved other cities in a search for good practice and soliciting for feedback on draft versions of the incentive programme. Based on this interaction with other cities Hamburg decided to have their financial incentive program based on surface and thickness of the green roofs instead of water retention capacity as is the case in most other programs in other cities. This decision led to constructors not only focusing on water retention but also considering other benefits that green roofs may have such as in the context of biodiversity and space utilization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the city a stakeholder group was established including housing estate companies, constructors, landscape architects and urban planners. Parallel to the dialogue with other cities this group was involved in defining the incentive programme. The group has remained active since and during its bi-annual meetings the Green Roof Strategy is evaluated by the working group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Hamburg seeks to raise awareness among the general population about all aspects of climate change and protection. It is systematically building up and expanding the range of easy-access information for the general public.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Roof Strategy fits within Hamburg’s aim to be a growing, yet climate-friendly and resilient, compact city. For this purpose green rooftops provide a financially beneficial and multifunctional solution. In addition to reducing climate change threats, they highly improve green quality space in the city. Investing in green roofs for adaptation to increased stormwater management and flooding risk is financially beneficial and minimizing the cost of upgrading the current sewage system. The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature, Building and Reactor Safety supports Hamburg’s Green Roof Strategy as a pilot project within their programme “Measures for adaptation to climate change”, providing financial support, networking and transfer of knowledge (information at <a href="http://www.ptj.de/folgen-klimawandel)">www.ptj.de/folgen-klimawandel)</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promotion and communication of the Green Roof Strategy are a top priority and several hurdles still have to be taken. For example, it has been questioned whether green roofs indeed provide the needed water retention capacities especially with a heavy storm water event. The concern is that support for this only stems from small scale experimental settings and that real and large roofs would not provide adequate retention service. To solve the matter HafenCity University is currently researching this question. Further, when initiating the Green Roof Strategy it was challenged whether Hamburg was having sufficient flat roofs to be able to succeed with the strategy. GIS-based research solved this question, showing that over 40% of the cities roofs are flat and suitable for greening. Another particular challenge requiring strong communication efforts on the positive benefits of green roofs has been the appearance of specific animals on the green roofs. On one of the industry flat roofs a sea gull colony of &#62;5000 individuals has found a new home, putting off other businesses to also install green roofs. Similarly, green roofs attract insects which may result in people deciding to not choose for a green roof. Communication and research for Hamburg therefore have shown to be a crucial component for succeeding with the Green Roof Strategy.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This section provides information regarding the specific benefits and costs of green roof installations in Hamburg, as well as the financing set-up of the Green Roof Strategy and the corresponding incentive programme that is provided via the strategy. Green roofs are an investment with clear future returns. A green roof can create a more pleasant building climate and help to save on heating or cooling costs. It insulates in winter and cools in summer resulting in energy savings varying from 2-44% depending on roof insulation measures separate from the green roof. It also protects the roof water proofing from weathering effects so that green roofs last up to twice as long as conventional flat roofs. Plants and substrate on green roofs retain a large amount of rain water, which results in additional savings of 50% on rain water fees for the owner in Hamburg. In those instances where the water discharge does not require connection to the sewage system, fees can be eliminated completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When comparing roof types, estimated costs for installation, maintenance and replacement over a period of 40 years cumulate to € 20.500 for 300 square meters surface both for grey and green roofs. When focusing only on the initial installation, a green roof costs € 9.500 versus € 3.000 for a grey roof for 300 square meters surface. Green roofs have got a bit higher maintenance cost; in many cities 50% reduced rain water fees and a longer lifetime of the roofing explaining the same overall costs over a period of 40 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburg’s Ministry for Environment and Energy invests ca. € 500,000 of its own resources for the implementation of the overall Green Roof Strategy, including efforts in all four areas of activity: promotion/support, dialogue and communication, scientific support, and policy/regulation. It also includes a full-time employee based at the Ministry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Hamburg’s Ministry for Environment and Energy and the Harbour City University receive € 300,000 in federal grants on expenditure basis from the German Ministry of the Environment under a funding programme supporting local activities for the adaptation to climate change. This federal grant on an expenditure basis is used to pay a full time communications officer and a part-time HafenCity researcher for 2-3 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Roof Strategy’s incentive programme has € 3 million at its disposal until the end of 2019. This amount includes the total remuneration to be provided under the financial incentive programme implemented via Hamburg’s investment and development bank (IFB), which handles all applications and transactions for the Green Roof incentives programme. Of the total € 3 million, € 2 million are sourced from the ‘implementation and service’ budget line of the Ministry responsible for city development and environment; the other € 1 million stems from the innovation fund of the Senate Office. The general approach taken is that financial incentives are available to those that voluntarily decide for a green roof before 2020. After that date Hamburg plans to have green roofs are compulsory by law. In particular, until 2020 building owners can receive subsidies to cover up to 30-60% of construction costs for the greening of their roofs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The multi-functionality of green roofs is reflected in the subsidy system supporting the Green Roof Strategy. A basic subsidy creates incentives to build a basic green roof while additional funding encourages more specialized, sustainable measures. Optional additional subsidies are then provided for: constructing high quality rooftops (root penetration protection and improving load bearing capacity for existing roofs), sustainable urban develop (inner city roofs, a green roof in combination with solar energy generation, and/or space utilization area) and an extra flood prevention by reducing rainwater discharge (improving run-off delay). The following minimum standard criteria must be fulfilled before a green roof can be eligible for a subsidy under the Green Roof Strategy:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Minimum 20 square meters net vegetation area and a maximum 30° roof pitch.</li>
<li>Minimum 8 cm substrate soil thickness on new and existing commercial and garage buildings or existing residential and office buildings.</li>
<li>Minimum 12 cm substrate soil thickness on all new residential and office buildings.</li>
<li>Public buildings owned by the city itself are not eligible for the subsidy.</li>
<li>Owners who voluntary decide for a green roof, and when it is not part of a binding green roof regulation.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The basic financial incentive then depends on the type of owner and size of the green roof:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Private owners with a 20 -100 square meters green roof who live themselves in the building receive a 40% subsidy on the total construction cost, including materials and contractor, and even up to 60% on material cost if the constructors are trained (professionals) either in architecture, roofing, landscaping or gardening thus ensuring high quality in construction.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For all other owners with a &#62;20 square meters green roof - commercial, private, public - an owner receives a basic financial incentive ranging from € 14/square meters (on 8 cm substrate soil thickness) to € 56/ square meters (on 50 cm substrate soil thickness) net vegetation area (maximum can be achieved via additional subsidy of € 1/ square meters of net vegetation area per additional centimetre substrate soil thickness (rooting layer thickness)).</li>
</ul>]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The current Green Roof Strategy combines the urban development policy objectives of sustainable area development with the objectives of adaptation to global warming and climate change. In Hamburg binding green roof regulation has been incorporated in many land-use plans for 20 years. Also, in accordance with the Nature Conservation Act green roofs are considered a possible measure in the context of compensating building impact on nature. From 2020 onwards Hamburg plans to have green roofs to be compulsory by law. The city of Hamburg also regularly reviews its green roof legislation in particular with regards to the ecological quality standards for the roofs. Specifically, when updating Hamburg’s regulations next time, the aim is to increase the standard green roof thickness up to 12-15 cm.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Roof Strategy started in 2014 when Hamburg had a total of 80 ha of green roofs. The incentive programme runs from December 2015 to 2019. Today Hamburg’s green roof surface has already increased to 124 ha. </p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Rainwater saving and use in households, Bremen]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Germany, for a long time a single fee for both rainwater and wastewater was levied in all communities. After some German court decisions the fee for rainwater was separated from wastewater one and is now based on the extension of impervious property surface (m<sup>2</sup>), which directs water into the public sewage system. Collecting rainwater on private property with e.g. rain barrel or infiltration system (as for example green space) is then likely to reduce sewage costs due to lower loads to be treated by the treatment plant. According to the court decision these cost savings have to be passed to the property owners resulting in lower rainwater fees per m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For several reasons (including saving of natural resources, reduction of pressures on the sewer systems, reduction of drinking water consumption, preservation of the natural water cycles and adaptation to climate change), Bremen has decided to take new approaches in rainwater management. On one hand Bremen is also applying this split fees and gives a refund if properties are less sealed and rainwater can filtrate into the soil or rainwater is used. In addition the city is subsidising investments into rainwater use in toilets, garden irrigation, collection tanks up to 12.000 Euro or a maximum of 1/3 of the total investment costs per household.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[Green building, fee, soil sealing, rainwater, subsidy]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For the area of Bremen climate projections are predicting higher temperatures and a change in precipitation. By the end of the century (2100), projections consistently indicate a significant increase in winter precipitation of up to 44 percent and a significant summer decline of up to 22 percent. For the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century inconsistent trends are projected in terms of precipitation and the number of rainy days. On the other hand, the temperature in all seasons is expected to constantly increase over the next century by up to 3.1 °C in the annual average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the winter period also more frequent extreme rainfalls are expected. In addition flood risk from sea and land side (including river, rain and groundwater flooding) are expected to increase. These changes will have an impact on the sewer system, in particular on its future design. Also more water retention measures for flood management will be needed. Therefore Bremen has decided to invest in decentralised rainwater management.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall objective of actions taken by the city of Bremen is to establish a natural water balance and to reduce the rainwater discharge into the sewerage system, supporting its use. At the same time drinking water consumption for certain uses in households should be decreased (e.g. toilet flushing).</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution provided to improve rainwater use in Bremen household is a combination of technical and economic approaches and applies to all private property owners. On one hand a rainwater cistern system is applied. Such a system of gutters and downspouts directs the rainwater collected by the roof to a storage cistern. The cistern, mostly located in the underground, may be constructed of various materials including cinderblock, reinforced concrete, precast concrete, fiberglass, or steel. The cistern supplies water to the household through a standard pressurized plumbing system. The rainwater can be used either for toilet flushing, but also for watering the garden. The installation of such systems in existing buildings requires adaptation of the piping system and some earthworks and is therefore sometime quite costly. In order to increase the uptake of the system and lower the costs a subsidy on the investment costs is given to the property owner. This subsidy can amount to a maximum of 12.000 Euros or a maximum of 1/3 of the total investment costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand the property owner gets the rainwater fee (0.63 €/m<sup>2</sup>/year) refunded if rainwater use is applied or the ground is kept permeable, as the fee is calculated on the sealed area. For properties larger than 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> the fee has to be split between rain and wastewater. Smaller properties can voluntary decide if such a split is feasible and convenient. In practice the larger the property is and the more water can be kept on the ground the more cost savings in comparison to sealed properties can be achieved.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the measures part of the approach taken by Bremen has not included stakeholder participation. However, citizens are among the main actors directly responsible for their implementation.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main success factor for using rainwater in households is the funding scheme (i.e. subsidies for the installation of the rainwater use system) provided by the Federal State of Bremen which enhances the environmental behaviour of house owners. According to information from the Bremer Umweltberatung (environmental consulting for Bremen), several citizens would like to have more eco-friendly houses, but without a proper funding they are rarely taking any actions concerning rainwater management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main barrier is that not all rainwater use solutions that could be established in households lead to a cost saving. Some house owners are also afraid of having construction works on their property. Therefore the implementation of such rainwater use systems is more easily when houses are newly constructed. High investment costs are also a significant barrier, which can be relieved by subsidies.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The rainwater fee for sealed and overbuilt area is 0.63 €/m<sup>2</sup>/year for the rainwater not discharged to the sewage system due to infiltration or use this fee is refunded. This refund is based on the individual circumstances on the property. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs of installing a rainwater use system are depending on the local context and amount at least to 6,000 Euros. The investment subsidy provided by the Federal State of Bremen amounts to a maximum of 12.000 Euros, and in any case cannot exceed 1/3 of the overall costs incurred by a property applying the rainwater use system.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The treatment of wastewater (including rainwater) is within the responsibility of the German communities; the costs of these services need to be paid by the property owner. Before 2010 communities have not been obliged to split the fees for the service between rain and wastewater. After some German court decisions the fee for rainwater needed to be separate from any wastewater fee and has now to be based on the size of impervious property surface, which directs water into the public sewage system.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The funding scheme was set up in the 1990s and has been developed further since then. The current scheme exists since 2016. The split of the fees for rain and wastewater are legally required since 2010.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Tatabánya, Hungary, addressing the impacts of urban heat waves and forest fires with alert measures]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Tatabánya has an approved comprehensive adaptation strategy, the Local Climate Change Action Plan, that is in its implementation stage. This Plan is based upon a comprehensive approach taking into consideration both mitigation and adaptation, incorporating climate considerations into decision-making, and including adaptation concerns in municipal processes. At this time, three measures have been implemented: (1) a local heat alert system; (2) the Smart Sun Educational Programme; and (3) building capacity of the fire brigade.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Pannonian]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatabánya has and will continue to face two major climate-related risks for which adaptation measures are required: heat waves (urban heat island effect in Tatabánya) and wild fires threatening the surrounding region and the health of the population (air pollution) caused by extreme temperatures and droughts.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A local heat alert system and the Smart Sun Educational Programme are designed to protect the public from the harmful impacts of high temperatures and UV radiations. They seek to:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Increase public awareness about heat waves impacts on health and on efficient measures for self-protection against unfavourably high temperatures;</li>
<li>Reduce the number of people exposed to the harmful effects of high temperature conditions and provide information that can reduce harmful effects on human health; and</li>
<li>Save resources through focusing on prevention measures rather than measures that address the consequences.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The measures directed at building the capacity of the fire brigade are designed to protect the public and forests from wild fires, and prevent biodiversity loss; They seek to:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent damage from the wild fires and health impacts due to the smoke and biodiversity loss; and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Prevent casualties among the fire-fighters due to the lack of training and capacity.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatabánya established a mix of soft measures to deal with the impacts of heat waves as well as wild fires.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatabánya has a heat and UV alert system in place: when extremely hot weather is predicted a heat wave and UV protocol is set in motion. The prediction is produced using high-tech weather prediction methodologies. The protocol consists of a series of activities that provide advice to citizens on how to prepare for the predicted heat wave. A key aspect is that information reaches citizens rapidly and though different channels. As soon as an impending heat wave is forecast the National Medical Officer of Hungary is informed. Instructions for citizens, institutions, health care organisations and media, updated every 30 minutes, are distributed through various media channels: the local and regional media are alerted. Information is also distributed through other channels: the city homepage, mail delivery and faxes to all authorities, institutions, public companies and employers. The heat alert system has been activated several times already: three times in 2009 and 2010, twice in 2011 and also three times in 2012. The UV alert system was activated once every year, except in 2012 when it was activated twice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Mayor’s Office, an increasing number of inhabitants are now aware of what they should do during an alert.  The institutions of the city, about 150, reply to alerts sent out by the Mayor’s Office and during an emergency act according to the plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Smart Sun Educational Programme the different vulnerable groups (e.g., infants and their parents, youngsters, old people and ill people) are made aware of the harmful effects of heat waves and high solar activity on the human body, as well as of the simple and effective measures on how to protect themselves and take care of other people (e.g., drinking 2-3 litres of still water per day, staying indoors or in shady places, wearing light hats, sun glasses, etc.). Adults are also made aware of their rights concerning the working environment, especially if their work includes outdoor activities. For example, employers should supply employees working outside with drinking water, proper clothing, and should take care of the work regime (1 hour of working outdoors in the heat wave should be followed by 30 minutes of rest).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Higher temperatures during longer periods, reduced precipitation, and changing wind patterns increase the risk of forest fires in many European regions. The city of Tatabánya in Hungary has enhanced the capability of fire brigades to fight forest fires by providing specialist training and equipment; improving the road network in forest areas thereby enhancing accessibility during a fire for the emergency services; providing watchtowers or camera systems that can help to detect fires early; and offering well-managed emergency response systems. The use of a fire weather index system helps the fire brigade to prepare for and respond to such events. A strengthening of local and regional disaster management has led to a reduction in damage from forest fires and the number of casualties among fire fighters.  An additional side benefit is that these measures have also helped with managing other natural hazards, such as storm events and floods, which are projected to occur more frequently as a result of projected climate change.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tatabánya Plan is the result of the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches. The plan was prepared with the assistance of the Sociological Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The City of Tatabanya has been supporting the initiatives proposed by the Academy and, by using the support of civil society, the problems of environmental protection and specifically those associated with climate change risks were addressed.<br />During the preparation of the Plan extensive stakeholder consultations took place. All relevant municipal bodies were involved: the department of education within the Municipality of Tatabánya, the National Public Health Institute, schools (teachers and students), nursery homes, local hospitals, engineers, utility providers (electric company, industrial enterprises, the transport managing company, waste managing companies etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover the heat and UV warning system is based on close cooperation and participation of 22 different organizations, such as local police, local ambulance service, local civil defence, local fire department, local disaster recovery, hospitals, water utilities and schools. The residents of Tatabanya, in fact, formed three groups, each involved in promoting local sustainability. Among their many accomplishments, they have implemented a heat and UV alert program, organized teams to assist in the development of a local climate strategy, initiated a call for tenders to achieve more energy efficient housing, established emissions reduction targets, and implemented educational and information programmes (the city has an annual budget for its housing program, which includes energy saving). The three groups and their goals are as follows:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The focus of the Inhabitants Group is to develop a new vision for the future of the city: they serve in a representative capacity in public decision making and through their efforts have helped to promote communication between residents and public officials by ensuring that local interests are known;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The second group is the Local Council of Pupils: this is comprised of student representatives who engage in a variety of tasks, including participating in local decision making; and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The third group is the Local Climate Group that is comprised of individuals from all walks of life including students, pensioners, doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, scientists, public officials, heads of companies, and inhabitants.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The alert starts from the Mayor’s Office that then informs about 150 institutions, who then send the alert forward to their workers, and to their contacts. Every institution thus informed know what their responsibilities are during an alert. Through this, and the media (local radio stations, and television), almost the entire population of the city learns about the alert. The Mayor’s Communication Office also informs the politicians. The Sociological Research Institute helped the City design the alert plan. Now the Institute has the professional knowledge, and they can also help other Hungarian municipalities and members of the Climate-Friendly Cities Association.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p>Development of the Strategy and Action Plan was made possible by utilising the budget for Environmental Education and Climate Change at the municipal level; staff was assigned from the Municipality of Tatabánya and from the Sociological Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>For 2009 the implementation budget from the Environmental Education and Climate Change Department, was HUF 4.000.000 (app. EUR 15.000) and a full time climate manager was assigned. The future aim is to establish a separate climate budget line. There is another budget source for implementation from the local Environmental Education Programme, approximately HUF 4.000.000 (app. EUR 15.000) per year.</p>
<p>Tatabánya’s approach to capacity building amongst fire-fighters is comprised of straightforward yet effective communication-focused measures designed to help avoid losses in forestry and green space and protect the population. The benefits are very likely to outweigh the costs because capacity building is an order of magnitude cheaper than the average costs of fire damage and lost ecosystem services.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tatabánya Plan is encouraged under the National Climate Change Strategy of Hungary adopted in 2008. The Department for Strategy and Control of Tatabánya has been the lead governmental body during the preparation, and it will be the leading implementing agency.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 1.5 years were needed to develop the strategy.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Storm water management in Växjö - the Linnaeus canal and Växjö lake lagoons, Sweden]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Växjö is situated in the southern part of Sweden, surrounded by forests and lakes. As many parts of the central City of Växjö were built upon wet and swampy areas they are vulnerable to floods after heavy rainfall events. One of the most affected parts is the street Linnégatan which is built on a previously existing small stream and which is situated much lower than the surrounding built areas. In past years, rainwater often flooded the street and the nearby buildings’ basements and cellars. At the end of the 1990’s, the City of Växjö started to reopen the canal in Linnégatan, i.e. the Linnaeus canal, in order to prevent the streets and surrounding areas from flooding and to regulate the flow of the storm water to the Växjö lake. The canal is an example on how adaptation to extreme weather events and environmental targets, i.e. the water quality of the Växjö Lake, can be combined in one system of integrated measures.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Boreal]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoCommentText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Annual floods were present and strongly affected the local infrastructure close to Linnégatan in the past. Streets were flooded for several days and nearby buildings ‘cellars were filled with storm water causing high cleaning and reconstruction costs. About 15 years ago, there was very little discussion about local climate change and its impacts; the guideline was to develop effective measures to be prepared for 10-year rainfalls – not in the context of climate change but in the context of highly recurrent heavy rainfall events.</p>
<p class="MsoCommentText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Dealing with 10-year rainfalls means that instead of expecting floods after every heavy rainfall event, floods are expected only once every 10 years. The major challenge was to define what a 10-year rainfall means and what can be expected, e.g. the total amount of rainfall per square meter and per a specific time-frame. About 15 years ago, a 10-year rainfall was 218 litres per second and hectare. Current projections assume about 250 litres per second and hectares what means an increase of 15 percent in 15 years. Thanks to the Linnaeus canal, the city of Växjö has avoided many floods during these 15 years and will be secured from most of the floods in the following years, also considering, at least in part, future climate change effects. Since the canal was built, there has only been one severe flood in August 2014.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This measure as other storm water management investments that has taken place in the recent years, was addressing current impacts of climate variability. However, the knowledge gained can be used to manage storm water and reduce the risks of floods even in the future, considering, at least in part, the effects of climate change. Since the city of Växjö has developed a climate adaptation strategy, more precise data are available and will help to develop future actions for climate change adaptation. Projections assume an increase in heavy rainfall events and thus more storm water due to climate change. The challenge for planners, technicians and others working at the municipality will be to necessarily increase the capacity of existing structures such as the Linnaeus Canal. The existing urban structure with buildings, streets and green space limits the facility to extend the Linnaeus Canal, for instance. Therefore, new measures have to be carried out in other locations in the city.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the past, there was a small-above ground stream at the location where the street Linnégatan runs today. The stream served as drainage and leads storm water to the inner city Växjö Lake. The stream was overbuild and canalized in the course of the street construction in the following years. This new below ground canal was not capable to store storm water after heavy rainfalls anymore, causing flooding of the neighbouring areas. Moreover, the water drained off to the Växjö lake taking residues, mineral oil and other waste to the lake. At the end of the 1990’s, the City of Växjö started to reopen the canal in Linnégatan, i.e. the Linnaeus canal, in order to prevent the streets and surrounding areas from being flooded and to regulate the flow of the storm water to the lake. The Linnaeus canal functions as a 220 m long storm water storage tank where the storm water is collected and discharged to the Växjö Lake via a below ground pipeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost all storm water from the central parts of Växjö finally ends up in the lake, potentially increasing its levels of nutrients, particles and heavy metals. In order to prevent this, the water from the Linnaeus canal is discharged into the sedimentation lagoons located nearby the lake. After passing the lagoons, the water is discharged into the lake. While the Linnaeus Canal and other types of systems for storage, delay and drainage of storm water have been realized in Växjö, it has also been important for Växjö to reduce the environmental impact on the central Växjö Lake. The realised measures aim to combine solutions to both hydraulic and environmental targets.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">At first it was planned to build the lagoons as dams in City Park next to the Växjö Lake. After the plans were published and made available to all interested parties, protest raised from citizens and environmental NGOs to change the original plan. Indeed, after roundtable discussions with these stakeholders, including the municipality as well, they came up with the solution to build lagoons in the lake. It turned out to be a better solution since the park could be untouched.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project became successful due to the synergies of various functions (storm water management and storage and control of pollutants) and other indirect benefits (such as those related to traffic safety and urban landscape issues). It was shown that it is possible to implement climate adaptation measures in a good design where it blends into the city landscape.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole investment cost nearly 2,000,000 €, of which about 15 % was funded by the Swedish Government via the Swedish Local Investment Program for Sustainable Development. The remaining part was funded by the Technical Department of the City of Växjö. Thanks to the investment, this part of the city is now mostly protected from floods after heavy rainfalls. The canal is dimensioned to manage the worst rainfalls estimated to occur only once every ten years. Since the construction of the canal, there have been a few floods, but not as often as before. So, this kind of storm water storage and delay system has proven to be efficient. Due to the expected future amount of rainfall there is a need for further improving measures to prevent flooding in Växjö. Experiences gained within this project will help to develop improved solutions and will provide a valuable example for other municipalities around Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One direct co-benefit of the canal has been that it has contributed to increased traffic safety in the street. The Linnaeus Canal is situated in the middle of the street, outside a secondary school. Before, there was a bigger risk for accidents between cars and people crossing the four lane street. Now, there are only two lanes and people have the possibility to wait on bridges over the canal before moving on to cross the other driving lane. Another environmental benefit is that the canal and the connected sedimentation lagoons, contribute to reduce the flow of storm water to the lake, and have also a positive effect on the water quality by reducing the amount of pollutants ending up in the lake. The Canal is not only an important part of Växjö’s storm water management. The open water body is a beautiful element within the city and also refers to the historic Växjö where a stream was originally situated in this area.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Swedish Environmental Code, storm water in planned areas shall be considered as waste water. Therefore, storm water is handled by the Environmental Code, which declares what amounts of pollutants are acceptable / non-acceptable. The organization Swedish Water (Svenskt Vatten) has recommendations on dimensions of disposal of storm water. These guidelines will be more ambitious from year 2015/2016 and will clearly describe “storm water systems” instead just of storm water pipeline dimensions that are mentioned in the current guidelines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another guideline from Swedish Water (Svenskt Vatten) deals with sustainable storm water management and gives advice for design and solutions in various situations. The praxis or recommendation for storm water management systems in Sweden is that they should have the capacity to handle 10-year rainfalls, under current conditions. This might change with climate change, and could require improved measures to deal with storm water management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both guidelines are not legally binding, but if something would happen, the municipality can absolutely be determined as responsible if the recommendations from Swedish Water were not met. The Linnaeus Canal is one example on how these recommendations can be fulfilled by a municipality.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Multi-Hazard approach to early warning system in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The county of Sogn og Fjordane frequently experiences avalanches and landslides, storm surges and flooding. Due to climate change and related impacts on extreme weather events above hazards are expected to be exacerbated; more extensive adaptation strategies and measures are therefore needed. This demonstration project (part of the EU funded Clim-ATIC project) explored the potential for an effective, reliable and cost-efficient early warning system that has a multi-hazard approach and makes use of location and population-based communication technologies, such as mobile phones, as well as social media such as Facebook and Twitter. The system was tested with a sample warning followed by a survey and data analysis to judge its efficacy.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Sogn og Fjordane is a coastal, mountainous region of Norway that boasts hundreds of thousands of tourist visits annually. Several communities in Sogn og Fjordane are facing numerous hazards such as flooding, avalanches, rock slides and other extreme weather events, that might be exacerbated by climate change. Great distances between peripheral communities and transport and communication infrastructure not accessible or available at times can make accessibility poor, thus making communities more vulnerable to extreme weather events.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">To respond to the above challenge an early warning system was set and tested in Aurland municipality, part of the Sogn og Fjordane county. Aurland is a region of great natural beauty but has a somewhat challenging geography and topography that results in frequent storm surges, floods, landslides and avalanches occurrences that might increase with the effect of climate change on the increase in frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events. The multi-hazard warning system would optimise rescue and other emergency services provided by the county. Due to tourism, it aims to be a cost-effective method reaching all people in the geographic area and not only residents.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Multi-hazard early warning systems utilise various media and communication tools to inform the public about impending hazards and provide guidance on the precautions to take. They can operate at a regional, national and international level and can contribute significantly to reducing the risks of personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property and the environment. Early warnings also enable local/regional authorities to initiate evacuations more efficiently.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">By demonstrating a people-centred early warning system, the aim was to establish how modern technology can help reduce the negative consequences of weather related hazards in current and climate changed conditions, thus also helping to prevent the loss of lives. A key aspect of the project has thus been to assess how a multi­hazard warning system can be established within a framework that considers the warning needs of different types of undesirable events and hazards.</p>

    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall aim of this project (part of the EU funded Clim-ATIC project) was to set, test and demonstrate a modern emergency population warning system by disseminating phone-based warning messages in a specified geographic area. As far as possible and appropriate, the system is based on already available modern technology and infrastructure, and anchored to existing legislative and institutional frameworks. In order to establish a cost-effective and sustainable early warning system, multi-hazard approach is a prerequisite, to share the costs among different scopes. The system and operational activities must therefore be established within a framework that considers the warning needs of all undesirable events and hazards (natural and man-made) and the requirements of various end-users.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Four reference group meetings were held between 2008 and 2010 to set objectives and discuss the best methods and approaches to be used in the early warning system, including setting system specifications for the trial message. The telephone was recognised to be the most important medium for distributing warnings (a combination of fixed and mobile phone lines). Text messages (SMS) and spoken messages alerting the public to a natural hazard or disaster are distributed to all phones within a certain distance from the natural hazard or disaster in question. Having defined the criteria for the phone-based population warning system, the next step was identifying potential system suppliers and forwarding the system criteria for feedback as regards their interest and ability to comply with the criteria and take part in the project. After the presentation of the two potential companies, the reference group concluded that technological aspects did not seem to represent a major challenge in respect to the population warning exercise, whereas budgetary restrictions were identified as key challenges to be overcome.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Before carrying out the population warning exercise, several dissemination activities were undertaken by the County Governor’s s Office. Information about the exercise was published on the County Governor’s website, Twitter profile and Facebook account, as well as being promoted through the local newspaper and the county-wide district radio station. The warning exercise on the 10 June 2010 was held in parallel with a table-top exercise focusing on local authorities’ ability to respond to extreme weather events. Several of the reference group members attended the exercise as observers. During the test, 2,500 mobile phones received the alert as text message, 322 fixed line phones in Aurland received the alert as voice message. The warning exercise was visible on Facebook for 2 hours and received 201,849 viewings. A post-exercise survey was carried out online and a door-to-door survey was conducted in the area of Høydalen to assess the public’s thoughts on the exercise. The population warning exercise was evaluated to measure the efficiency of the warning system by combining an electronic evaluation form and a door-to-door survey.</p>
<p class="Default" style="margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Following the demonstration project, the warning system has not been implemented yet; neither locally nor on a national level. In recent years, the county of Sogn og Fjordane has seen numerous cases of extreme weather events such as severe land slides and flooding, in parallel with large-scale and highly dramatic fire incidents. No one has been killed in these events, but they all served as a reminder; underlining the need for a population-centered warning system with a multi-hazard approach. Hence, the County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane has argued that such a system ought to be implemented. However,  no activities has followed and it is not clear if national authorities will prioritize the implementation of a warning system. In case national authorities decide against the full-scale implementation of a multi-hazard warning system, the project reference group aims to follow up the Clim-ATIC project at regional level; primarily in the county of Sogn og Fjordane. In this respect, the work will be closely developed with local / regional authorities, the health sector and relevant governmental agencies in order to assess and implement a warning system at regional level.</p>

</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">As our angle of approach was to demonstrate a system with a multi-hazard approach, the project reference group played a key role in defining a system specification that enabled efficient and reliable issuing of multi-hazard warnings.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to establish a cost-effective early warning system, multi-hazard approaches are a prerequisite, as the costs of using and maintaining the system will be shared. A location-based warning system can also represent an integrated tool for disseminating purely informative messages, such as general public information or various messages from local authorities. Hence, this project demonstrated how an existing county-encompassing organization could be used to issue the population warning. As this organization is closely coordinated with the police whilst being an inter-municipal organization, it is thus suited for the issuing of both non-emergency and emergency warnings with a multi-hazard approach. We have argued that the technical aspects of people-centred warning systems are at large readily available, whereas issues concerning confidentiality legislation and system regulations must be addressed before successfully implementing efficient location-based warning systems. As we have demonstrated, publishing advertisements using social media is also subject to regulations. Actually, there are legislative barriers in terms of confidentiality rules that prevent geographic data collected by telemobile companies from being shared publicly. However, this information could be crucial for fast deployment of emergency services and therefore needs to be changed. In order to issue warnings which are “timely and understandable to those at risk”, we believe more research needs to be carried out on the opportunities and restrictions connected with the use of social media during crisis situations.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The early-warning system was developed and tested with Clim-ATIC; this is an EU-project (2008-2011) which dealt with communities’ ability to develop adaptation capacities to face a future climate, where the frequency and scale of extreme weather is believed to increase. Clim-ATIC WP4 related to the implementation of adaptation demonstration projects, and one of these WP4-projects was located in the County of Sogn og Fjordane. The resources needed for this demonstration project are in the form of staff time costs (95,191 Euro) and office overhead costs (up to 9,943 Euro) for the County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane. The total project cost was 105,145.00 Euro. 55,377.00 Euros were provided as a match funding commitment by the County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and the remaining 49,768.00 Euro by Northern Periphery Programme (NPP), which is part of the European Commission’s Territorial Cooperation Objective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the project demonstrated that modern warning system technology can be combined with existing infrastructure and organizational patterns to enable local authorities to issue population warnings in a cost-effective and sustainable way. The existing inter-municipal emergency operations center, Alarmsentralen, is a county-encompassing monitoring and warning service that is already manned around the clock by highly qualified staff. Embedding a population warning system in this organization will incur little cost, training or resources. Moreover, as climate change is generally expected to lead to more frequent natural disasters and extreme weather frequency in years to come, an early warning system will therefore constitute an important part of local communities' climate change adaptation strategies, being this the major expected benefit.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “emergency population warning system” project is mentioned in a proposition report by the National Defence Committee (see appendix 3 of the document available), which discussed the need for a modern system for population warning. Furthermore, the majority of the committee stated that efficient population warning by the use of modern technology constitutes an important lifesaving and damage preventive tool, which Norway must aim to implement. In the National Vulnerability and Emergency Planning Report for 2010 (see appendix 4 of the document available), the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning also addresses the need for establishing a more modern population warning system.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The demonstration project was realised in 2008 - 2011. There is the possibility, still not evident at the moment, that the early warning system will be operationally implemented in the future, through either national or regional administrations.</p>

    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Klaipėda is a coastal city with almost all of its territory located on coastal lowland, and the Smeltalė river situated in the Southern part of the city, falling into the Curonian Lagoon within the city area. Regular floodings of the southern city areas due to flash floods in the Smeltalė River and Baltic Sea level fluctuations are the main problem of the Klaipėda city case study area. In addition to natural occurring flood events, climate change contributes to an increase in the likelihood and adverse impacts of flood events. Based on the assessment of climate change impacts local community adaptation actions were initiated in the Smeltalė River basin by the stakeholders, scientists, and the local interest groups.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Klaipėda is a coastal city. Almost all of its territory is located on coastal lowland, which is why areas of Klaipėda city are vulnerable to flooding. The Smeltalė River is situated in the Southern part of Klaipėda city, and has a catchment area of 124.1 square kilometres. The Smeltalė flows into the Klaipėda Strait, which connects the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon. The shores of the Smeltalė River are not reinforced, so the area near the river is not protected from flooding. The lower reaches of the Smeltalė River are situated in the lowland where the land surface is almost flat. Consequently, the floodplain of the Smeltalė River is wide. The lower reaches of the Smeltalė River, situated in Klaipėda city, are highly urbanized, with impervious surfaces covering a considerable area. The natural flow paths are replaced by the rain drainage system. Consequently, the flash flood peak discharge is much larger than that in natural conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooding of surrounding areas (water can reach the built-up areas) is one of the most important problems associated with high water levels and flash floods by the Smeltalė River. The water level rise in the Baltic Sea will affect the water level regime in the Smeltalė River’s lower reaches. It is likely that the extreme water levels will also be affected by sea level rise. Extreme water levels in the Baltic Sea near Klaipėda are related to storm surges. The change in the intensity and frequency of heavy rain, flash floods and sea level rise can also affect the area of flooded territory and the frequency of flooding. The change in the flash-flood regime may also change the sediment regime of the Smeltalė River and the pollution from the rain drainage system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the initial stage of the adaptation process, analysis of climatic parameters and sea-level change was carried out and projections for the twenty-first century were prepared. Climate projections were used as the background for hydrological modelling which has been carried out, and possible future changes in the hydrological regime were determined. All modelling results indicate a sea-level rise of between 25 and 86 cm (mean value of the whole forecast: 52 cm) in Klaipėda in the twenty-first century. Recurrence of heavy precipitation in Klaipėda will also increase by up to 30%. The hydrological modelling results of potential changes in the Smeltalė river flow regime in the twenty-first century show that the risk of flooding for nearby residents will increase in the future due to the sea-level rise and heavy rain. A rise in flooding magnitude and frequency is very likely. The area of flooding will increase.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal of the project is to assess the effect of climate change on the extent and scale of the problems in the future for the Smeltalė River hydrologic regime and initiate local adaptation action. Moreover adaptation to climate change impacts was focused on the involvement of local stakeholders into the decision-making process and actions in the Smeltalė River basin.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to identify the suitable adaptation measures two scenario workshops were held with the Klaipėda city municipality administration and various stakeholders. At the first workshop the projections of sea level rise and flash flood peak flow changes were presented and possible adaptation measures were identified together with the stakeholders. This was followed by a feasibility study on the costs and the efficiency of 4 adaptation measures proposed by the stakeholders and two additional measures, proposed by the authors of the feasibility study (Vilniaus Hidroprojektas Ltd., 2010). The stakeholders have decided that the most suitable measure for the Smeltalė River lower reaches will be complex embankment and dyke systems on both watersides of the river. This measure was considered the most expensive, but also the most suitable adaptation measure concerning efficiency, implementation costs and long-term durability (due to climate change impacts). Moreover, embankments should be incorporated in the recreation area which will be established in the area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the decisions from the workshops, the Klaipėda city municipality initiated the preparation of the implementation of the adaptation measures in the Smeltalė River lower reaches, ‘The Smeltalė River park’ project. The recreation area of the Smeltalė River Park will be developed on the river embankments. The dykes proposed in the Smeltalė River park plan should protect flood-prone areas. The project will be implemented in several stages. First of all, the dykes and walking paths will be constructed. After that the rest of the infrastructure will be implemented due to Klaipėda city detailed plan requirements.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation was a key aspect in this case study, due to the fact that stakeholders were integrated in all stages of the case study, starting with the identification of the problem and of possible adaptation measures as well as the evaluation process and the final decision-making of best adaptation measures. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) assessing the economical parameters and Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis involving social, ecological, aesthetical and other measuring criteria were used as supporting decision tools, during the different workshop. Stakeholders that participated in the process included: Klaipeda water company, schools, universities, local newspaper, harbour, Regional EPD, NGOs, community members, private companies, different departments of Klaipėda city municipality (Environmental, Landscape architecture, Civil protection, Projects), City council members.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The case study is a good example where cooperation of various stakeholders was key for a comprehensive approach and a commonly accepted solution;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The engagement of various stakeholder during the various phases of the project and decision-making process; The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) were helpful tools in this process;</li>

</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The preliminary costs of dyke system on both watersides of the Smeltalė river is about 5 million Euros (including river bed canalization works, but without land taxes). The calculations were made by Vilniaus Hidroprojektas Ltd. in 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover a survey for stakeholders about Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was prepared and distributed. It consisted of 8 questions about possibilities to use these methods for the Smeltalė River basin. A damage cost assessment scheme for the Smeltalė river basin flood events was made according to respondents’ answers. The most feasible and most important criteria are related to infrastructure and building value assessment. Meanwhile, ecological and social criteria are quite difficult to assess. The nine different MCDA methods were used to assess the adaptation measures. According to the 7 of 9 MCDA methods the best adaptation measure appears to be – the complex embankments and dykes system on both watersides of the river. Meanwhile, the most favourable measure gleaned from the questionnaire is the best choice using only 2 of 9 MCDA methods – the dyke system on both watersides of the Smeltalė river.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The enforcements of the Smeltalė river banks became possible without any change of legislation in the area. The urban area of the Smeltalė river basin was marked as general public territory in the Klaipėda city development plan (certified in 5 April 2007). This status was favourable to establish the technical project of the Smeltalė River Park, which was assigned at 18 June 2012.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Timmendorfer Strand coastal flood defence strategy, Germany]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1999 to 2011, the municipality of Timmendorfer Strand in Germany developed and implemented a coastal flood defence strategy using a participatory process. In 1999, a first discussion about an integrated coastal flood defence concept for the community of Timmendorfer Strand started. It was agreed that the concept should be accepted by a large number of stakeholders. Therefore, an innovative method for active public participation including an analysis of social and economic parameters was used in the process of selecting the coastal flood defence measures to be applied. The selected defence measure was a new sheet pile wall integrated in the natural beach ridge. The realisation of the sheet pile wall was completed by 2011. The coastal defence measure was adjusted to the needs of a touristic beach city, e.g. the height allows the sea to be viewed from the beach promenade. Furthermore glazed retention walls were built close to cafes. The coastal defence measure was combined with architectural finishing and landscaping which included for example the reconstruction of the beach promenade.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Timmendorfer Strand is located at the temperate zone of the Baltic Sea Region and large part of it lays no more than 3 meters above sea level. With respect to climate change, it is mainly threatened from impacts due to sea level rise and storm floods. From a coastal defence perspective, changes in mean and maximum water levels and sea condition caused by climate change are predominantly relevant. Both parameters (water level and sea conditions) are essential basis for the dimensioning of the coastal flood defences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since regional climate projections are scarce, the official master plan for coastal defence from the German Federal State Schleswig-Holstein uses IPCC projections combined with regional modelling aspects to generate statements about possible climate change impacts. Sea level and precipitation are expected to rise in the future causing increased hydrological loads on coastal defence measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing coastal flood defence structures were seen “rather critical”, since it was estimated that a breaching of the spits will occur with a water level of about 2.1 m above mean sea level. Results from the study undertaken by the coastal defence administration showed that Timmendorfer Strand was not enough protected against future flooding (based on increase of seal level rise in last 100 years, and future projections for the next 100 years by 40-60 cm). The fact that the last catastrophic storm surge happened about 130 years ago and that Timmendorfer relies on tourism (depending on broad, idle beaches) led to a sceptical view of the local population towards coastal flood defence. It became clear, that an appropriate coastal defence solution for the area could only be achieved with active participation and acceptance of the local population. Therefore a participatory coastal flood defence process was conducted.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking the described challenges (climate related threats and their intensification) into account and given that mean sea level rise in the region amounted to approximately 0.15 cm per year between 1900-2000, it became evident that the main coastal flood defence (which was a natural beach ridge with a maximum height of about 3.5 m above mean sea level) was insufficient to ensure the safety of the population and the economic assets at Timmendorfer Strand. Hence as coastal ecosystems as well as the population and their property values were in threat of climate change effects, the objectives were:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">to increase risk awareness and communication</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to discuss appropriate solutions based on the communities values and needs with community members, and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to renew the coastal flood defence structure.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of a coastal flood defence measure of Timmendorfer Strand and Scharbeutz was a participatory process. The work started already in 1999 and the last implementation on site was conducted in 2011. The definition of the coastal defence concept followed three steps: assessment of socio-economic values, sensitivity analysis, and an ideas competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, the socio-economic assessment revealed the potential damage in case of a flooding, which highlighted the need for improved coastal flood defence. Socio-economic parameters, like persons employed, tourist bed capacity, economic assets, or yearly gross value added were evaluated. Around 15% of the area is situated less than 3 m above mean sea level and therefore flood-prone. In the early years of the last decade, around 5,500 people lived in this area and capital assets amounting to 3,423 million were counted. This area was not enough protected by coastal defence and would have been flooded if an event like the one that took place in 1872 reoccurred. The 1872-event reached about 3 m above sea level and flooded the entire coastal lowlands of Timmendorfer Strand. The socio-economic assessment was the basis for the second step: a sensitivity analysis with the participatory approach. With a computer-aided model, possible future developments under different sea level rise scenarios were simulated at different stakeholder events. The focus of these meetings was the analysis of how different coastal flood defence measures would affect the community system. The results of this step then formed the basis of the third step: an “ideas competition”, where four engineering offices were asked to develop innovative ideas for coastal flood defence measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agreed coastal flood defence measure was a sheet pile wall integrated in the natural beach ridge. This measure ensures defence of the area up to a storm flood with a water level of 2.50 m above mean sea level. A higher wall was not supported by the majority of the local stakeholders due to the expected consequences on tourism, which is the main economic sector in the community. Moreover, to improve local acceptance of the defence measures, glazed retention walls were built close to cafes, thus enabling the view of the sea.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Initiated by the Schleswig-Holstein State Ministry for the Rural Areas, State Regional Planning, Agriculture and Tourism (MLR, now MELUR) in 1999, the measure took over 10 years to its finalization in 2011. The main outstanding aspect of the implementation of the coastal flood defence strategy in Timmendorfer Strand is the participatory approach. During the participatory approach, nine working groups meetings and two public meetings were held. At the nine working groups meetings more than 50 local stakeholders (coastal protection authority, fishermen, tourism representatives, local residents and community authorities) participated. The focus of these meetings was the analysis of how different coastal flood defence measures would affect the community with the assumption of increasing risks of flooding due to climate change. Thematically these nine meetings were split in two steps. The first step included five meetings, were the “system” Timmendorfer Strand was defined by the participants. Variables were collected and relationships between these variables were disclosed. The second step, including four meetings, was aimed at specific aspects concerning sustainable solutions in coastal defence measures. For example, it was discussed how flood defence measures affect key variables (elaborated in step 1) in Timmendorfer Strand. As results of this approach, the participants supported the results of the sensitivity analysis. They also agreed upon being further involvement in the process of the implementation of the coastal flood defence measure. The coastal defence administration valued this approach very positive, because the participants recognized the long-term risk for the coastal area, they accepted responsibility, and they “evolved from sceptics to advocates of an integrated coastal defence concept”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the participation process different versions of the finally proposed coastal flood defence measure were discussed (especially differing in the height of the wall). The compromise to build a wall but lower than the one proposed by the regional government (of federal state of Schlwesig-Holstein) was found together with the stakeholder and citizens; lower height enables tourists and citizens to still walk behind the wall and see the sea. The participative process had a strong component of awareness rising and avowal of proposed coastal flood defence measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the cost-benefit analyses of the measures a limited number of local stakeholders were interviewed. Some of them are part of the local parliament or active members of the community and were interviewed to gather information on the perceptions on effects after implementation of the measure. Other contacted local stakeholders are restaurant owners who were interviewed to gather data on changes of restaurant incomes. Furthermore, the local tourism office and the city council were also contacted.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the initiative to this process was coming from the authorities (top-down approach), the citizens of Timmendorfer Strand were not involved in initiating the participatory process. But because of their fears of the defence measure (sheet pile wall) regarding the attractiveness for tourists (tourism is the most important economic sector in the municipality), they had to be convinced, that coastal defence is necessary. So, a key success factor was that the authorities took a very inclusive approach and developed measures which fitted the values of the community. Another key success factor was that the Timmendorfer Strand community was able to finance parts of the additional costs which made the adopted solution adjusted to the needs of a touristic city, e.g. the glazed retention walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The relative low numbers of participants (25) per meeting could be seen as a limiting factor, but as those participants had wider duties in the community they can be seen as multipliers and thus representatives of the wider public of the community of Timmendorfer Strand.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Costs and benefits of the implementation of coastal flood defence were quantified as far as possible for two scenarios. Minimum scenario referred to a sea level rise of 0.30 m and an according increased frequency of flood events; maximum scenario shows a seal level rise of 0.50 m and the following increase in flood events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Estimated costs include investment and maintenance costs of the coastal flood defence measure and cost related to the architecture finishing and landscaping project. Following benefits were considered in the analysis: avoided flooding, change of recreational function and tourism due to finishing and landscaping project, change of number of travellers to community, change of property values and qualitative assessment of change of turnover of restaurant owners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The implemented measure was compared to a business-as-usual scenario, with no implementation of the coastal defence interventions and of the finishing and landscaping project. The two different estimated scenarios differ in the impacts of the climate change, change of property value, additional tourism and maintenance costs. For both scenarios, the estimated benefits exceed the costs of the measure: net present value ranges between 92 and 220 million euro. The estimated benefits are between 4 and 8 times higher than the estimated costs (benefit-cost ratio). The investment-upfront costs are the major type of costs with 30 million euro (for both scenarios) and the main type of benefits is avoided damages by storm surges (71.5 million euro for the minimum and 170 million for the maximum scenario in the period 2011-2100). Also the additional tourism shows substantial benefits, ranging between 45 and 72 million euro (for the period 2011.2100). The undertaken sensitive analysis showed that for all scenarios and all discount rates used benefits are higher than costs. The net present value is positive and the benefit-cost ratio is higher than one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A further cost-benefit analysis was the change of turnover of restaurants analysed. The existing beach promenade was improved which means that there are more possibilities for outside seating, and additional wind protection realized. The data on change of turnover was elaborated by interviews with restaurants in Niendorf which is a district of Timmendorfer Strand. The answers ranged from no major changes to an increase of turnover of 5 per cent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investment costs were covered mainly by the regional government of Schleswig-Holstein which is responsible of coastal protection for this area. Furthermore, the community covered a certain share of the costs. Also EU funding via Cohesion Policy was used (especially for the landscape and finishing project). From the total of 30 million of euro, 31% (9.5 million euro) were covered by the community.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Realisation of flood protection measures for the city of Prague]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2002, Prague experienced severe flooding with total damage of 24 billion CZK (1 billion euro). This event was recognized as one of the most expensive weather-related disaster in the history of the city with heavy damages on infrastructure, housing and environment. Future climate scenarios predict a change in the number and intensity of extreme events, inter alia, increasing the risk of river flooding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the 2002 event, the implementation of flood control measures by Prague municipality substantially speeded up. The flood control system constructed in Prague consists mostly of grey infrastructure, such as fixed and mobile barriers and safety valves in the canalisation network along the Vltava River. The implemented adaptation measures were assessed using a cost benefit analysis which showed that the benefits are greater than the costs even if only one event with a return period of 50 years (Q50) is considered.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Prague is the capital city of the Czech Republic, located in a temperate climate zone. Vltava River, the longest river in the Czech Republic flows through the historical centre of Prague that has been prone to floods in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the changing climate, the greatest expected impacts are potentially related to temperature changes, wetter winters, dryer summers, increase in precipitation extremes and in climate variability in general. The Czech Republic is one of the countries most threatened by future floods in terms of extent and cost of possible damage, and it is therefore absolutely crucial to invest in adaptation and flood protection measures. In 2002, Prague experienced severe flooding (with a return period of 500-year) with total damage of 24 billion CZK (1 billion euro). This event was recognized as one of the most expensive weather-related disasters in the history of the city with heavy damages on infrastructure, housing and environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The capital city has yet no strategy to deal with climate change impacts. Some tentative adaptation measures have been very briefly mentioned in the City Strategic plan, which is currently being updated. Prague city recently joined Mayor Adapt initiative and aims to develop adaptation strategy in the coming two years (2017-2018). However, with regard to adaptation in water management, after the 2002 event, Prague municipality has been developing and implementing a variety of flood control and protection measures, which, in practice, contribute to adaptation to climate change in this sector.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The 2002-flood substantially speeded up the development of a more resilient flood risk management system to protect the city of Prague. Although, at that time, the flood protection measures were not presented and named as climate change adaptation measures because climate change adaptation was not a topic issue on the political agenda, the identified measures aimed to increase resilience to flood risk, also in a climate change perspective. In particular, realised measures can cope with flooding events with a return period of 500-years, thus considerably increasing Prague resilience towards extremes events.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The flood protection system of Prague has been now finished and protects most parts of Prague from flood with 1 to 500 years return period. Before the construction of such protection system, the area threatened by floods in Prague was 57.5 square kilometres (in total 11.6% of the city). Overall 52.5 square kilometres of the previously threatened area is now protected against flooding. The areas with limited flood protection consist of Sedlec and Troja areas and areas of Vltava and Berounka river confluence, which are not densely populated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To protect the city, its inhabitants and the priceless historical heritage from such great floods there was a need for grey infrastructure, as further described below. Green and blue infrastructure would only serve as some kind of additional support to the flood barriers and can be very useful for example to tackle flash floods caused by extreme precipitation. Greener strategies or approaches have not been realised along the Vltava River. However, these approaches are implemented when revitalizing smaller streams in the city, like for example Rokytka. The specific adaptation measures implemented to control Vltava river floods include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Fixed barriers (levees, dykes, earth mounds, solid concrete walls) constructed along the Vltava River. For instance, closure at Čertovka (Old Town), which is a steel sliding door, 23.5 m length, 4.9 meters height, and weighting 45 tonnes.</li>
<li>Mobile barriers which are mainly used in the old historical centre, and partly in the surrounding areas. Mobile barriers are stored in a central storage area in Dubeč and for smaller parts in Zbraslav. The transport and installation of mobile barriers to the areas potentially affected by flooding is based on the Flood Management Plan of the Prague City. In Dubeč, a training area for training of mobile barriers installation is built.</li>
<li>Other measures, as closures, pumping systems and safety valves in the canalisation network along the Vltava River.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The 2002 extreme flood was a trigger that speeded up the process of the construction of flood protection measures. Based on the 2002 flood experience, the flood control measures were improved and designed to protect city from 2002 flood (Q 2002 = 5160 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), which corresponds to a water level of 782 cm with safety reserve of 30 cm. The area of flood protection measures in Zbraslav district was designed for 100 year flood with safety reserve of 30 cm. The construction of the flood control system in Prague was realised throughout 8 phases, each one addressing a specific sector of the Vltava River. The total length of flood protection measures (fixed barriers, solid concrete walls and mobile barriers) after the completion of all stages is approximately 19.255 km, of which 6.925 km are mobile barriers.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The responsibility for flood protection measures which have been implemented since 1997 is at the national level divided between two institutions: the Ministry of Agriculture, which is responsible primarily for the implementation of technical measures, and the Ministry of the Environment that together with various non-governmental organizations and local initiatives are the main promoters of ‘‘green’’ adaptation measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the regional level, Prague City Hall in cooperation with the Povodí Vltavy, a State enterprise, is responsible for implementation of flood control measures on the Vltava River and small watercourses. Some environmentally oriented organizations and local initiatives of citizens raising suggestions are also involved in the adaptation process through consultations. The stakeholders involved include Prague City Hall, affected Prague districts, political representatives, the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Povodí Vltavy - Vltava River Basin and professional companies (eg. Hydrosoft).</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main problems occurred during the approval and permit process of flood control system installation, such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Questions of property rights and relations of land that was in the area of the planned flood control system (needed for purchase or exchange of land). Land ownership and property relations often hinder the implementation of such measures.</li>
<li>Coping with the requirements of cultural and historical heritage preservation authorities, especially in the historical centre, where the line of the mobile flood control measures was required to be as invisible as possible.</li>
<li>Conflicting views of investors, designers, and the historical heritage authorities regarding the implementation of flood protection measures, in order to maintain the panoramas in the historical parts of the city.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The success of the implemented flood protection system was proved during 2013 flood event, when great part of the city along Vltava River was protected and only very minor parts were flooded. On the other hand, the 2013 flood event highlighted the “weak points”, such as the capacity of the pumping station on Rokytka creek that is planned to be enlarged based on this flood event.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs and benefits of the implemented flood protection measures were calculated for particular events with different return period: 20, 50, 100 and 500-year flood. The estimated total cost amounts to 145.94 Million euro (2013) and includes: total cost of the realisation of the flood control system (144.4 Million EUR, 2013), installation costs per event (0.65 Million euro, 2013), annual maintenance and storage costs (0.89 Million euro, 2013). The costs did not include damage to the underground. The estimated benefits include avoided damage costs in Million euros of:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>Residential buildings, ranging between 332 (Q20) and 1,971 (Q500);</li>
<li>Infrastructure and industrial buildings, ranging between 124 (Q20) and 613 (Q500);</li>
<li>Equipment, ranging between 42 (Q20) and 254 (Q500);</li>
<li>Citizen´s evacuation, cleaning and other costs, ranging between 42 (Q20) and 74 (Q500);</li>
<li>Environmental and cultural assets, ranging between 38 (Q20) and 57 (Q500).</li>
</ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Costs caused despite the flood control system are estimated to range between -410 (Q20) and -966 (Q500) Million euros. Total avoided damage costs are (in Million EUR) are therefore between 168 (Q20) and 2,003 (Q500).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If costs and benefits are compared for each event, it is possible to see that benefits are greater than costs for the event with a return period of 50 years (Q50) and more. Benefits are slightly greater than costs also for flood events Q20. However, flood events with a return period of 20 years could appear more times than once in the 80 years (life span of the measures), which would make the comparison negative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if a scenario where there would be just one event of Q50 (or events with longer return period, i.e. Q100 and Q500) during the expected life span of the measures (about 80 years) is considered, the benefits would still overweight the costs, also despite the annual maintenance and storage costs. Based on calculations it is possible to argue that if at least one event of Q50/100/500, or Q20 with a combination with another event (Q20/50/100/500) or any other combination of these occur, the flood control system investment will return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Prague an implementation of grey infrastructure including flood barriers was essential in order to effectively protect the city centre. Based on the performed cost-benefits analysis it proved to be a very effective investment. However, there are still possibilities to adopt green and blue measures on small streams (e.g. in Rokytka or Botič).</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The relevant legislation for the implemented flooding protection measures includes:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The Water Framework Directive (EC 2000) and the Flood Directive (EC 2007). The current Czech flood risk management is based on the Strategy for Protection against Floods approved by the government in 2000 and updated in 2006.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Plan for the Main River Basins, which is an important strategic document for water planning. Issued by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2007, it includes flood protection among its three main topics. The document places great emphasis on preventive protection and recognizes that a suitable combination of measures in the landscape that increase natural water retardation and technical measures addressing flood run-off are necessary for effective flood protection.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Spatial Development Policy, which is a strategic document for coordination of spatial planning. (e.g. Spatial Plan in Prague).</li>
</ul>]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The flood protection measures were constructed from 1997 to 2012. The implementation of these measures was rather long-term including design, project preparation and construction of the particular measures.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Habitat restoration and management in the Ebro delta coastal lagoons]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alfacada and Tancada coastal lagoons are located in the Delta del Ebro Natural Park. The lagoons are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly sea level rise, in combination with sediment deficit due to river regulation, leading to exacerbated coastal erosion and subsidence. Local management practices (e.g. intensive rice farming) have also affected the natural habitats and species, causing wetland loss and changes in salinity and water quality. Habitat restoration and management measures have thus been implemented to improve resilience against sea level rise and recover the hydrological connectivity and the ecological quality of the coastal lagoons.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alfacada and Tancada coastal lagoons are located in the Delta del Ebro Natural Park. Although the Alfacada lagoon is a protected area, it was until recently a private estate used for hunting; this has led to isolation from the sea and the river and the introduction of freshwater from the irrigation system for the neighboring rice fields. The Alfacada lagoon is also vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sediment deficit, since the area close to the river mouth is quickly retreating. Therefore specific management and restoration measures are necessary to mitigate these negative effects. The salt marshes of the Tancada lagoon have been damaged by intensive fish farming and much work was required to restore this now protected area to its natural state, recovering its connectivity with the Alfacs Bay through the removal of dikes.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of this project is to improve the ecological status of the Alfacada and Tancada lagoons through habitat restoration and management measures, such as the removal of infrastructures that interfere with this connectivity, creating new lagoon habitats in existing rice fields and restoring marsh habitat in abandoned aquaculture facilities. The main specific objectives of the project are to:</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Improve the ecological and hydrological connectivity of the Alfacada lagoon with the implementation of restoration measures designed to reduce the effects of coastal erosion and climate change, and improve the status of priority habitats and species;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase the Alfacada coastal lagoon habitat, restoring the original lagoon areas that have been converted to rice fields;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve the ecological status and the hydrological connectivity of the old salt pans of Sant Antoni (Tancada lagoon area), through the restoration of areas affected by abandoned aquaculture facilities;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop procedures to monitor and disseminate ecological values of the restored areas, so as to increase public awareness and knowledge among users and managers of the spaces, as well as society in general.</li>
</ol>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main adaptation measure, to increase resilience against sea level rise, is the reestablishment of the hydrological connectivity between the lagoons and the sea such that the sediment inputs to the lagoons are increased during marine storms. Several measures have been implemented to deal with the consequences of sea level rise and habitat degradation. Main measures implemented included:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>To improve the hydrological network of the Alfaca lagoon, by cleaning the canals that bypass the lagoon and building a new canal that connects directly the lagoon and the river;</li>
<li>To improve the hydrological connection of the salt marshes, that were divided by dikes and isolated one from another;</li>
<li>To naturalize rice fields back to coastal lagoon and an old aquaculture facility back to salt marsh habitat;</li>
<li>To create small islands as nesting areas for sea birds;</li>
<li>To limit land accesses to some areas in order to mitigate the impacts of predators and human frequentation;</li>
<li>To reintroduce the European pond turtle.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Results of the implementation of these measures are being monitored. However, monitoring has not finished and there are no results available yet.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main institutional stakeholders (Government of Spain and Government of Catalonia) are partners of the project. The project is formally supported by the city councils of the two towns where the lagoons are located (Amposta and Sant Jaume d’Enveja). Other stakeholders are informed and consulted during several meetings but they don’t actively participate in the project.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">So far the project has achieved all the planned goals, though some actions have been delayed, due to administrative problems between the Government of Spain and the Government of Catalonia. The main delay has been the restoration of rice fields back to coastal lagoon in Alfacada.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total cost for the implementation of the project was 3.054.703 € (EU Life+ funding was 1.490.084 €). The main benefits are the restoration of wildlife habitats (62 ha of new habitats), the recovery of some protected species and the increased resilience of the lagoons and marshes against sea level rise. Economic benefits include the creation of jobs for the execution of the project and for the new visitor centre built in the Tancada lagoon. No monetary valuation of the benefits has been carried out.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Flood protection in the Upper Vistula river basin: grey and green measures implemented in the Sandomierz area]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Vistula River is a 1,046 km long river which springs in southern Poland and ends in the Baltic Sea. The Upper Vistula extends over the three Polish provinces of Małopolskie, Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie. The Upper Vistula region covers an area of 43,000 km<sup>2</sup>, including the cities of Krakow, Tarnow, Kielce, Nowy Sacz, Rzeszow, Przemysl and Krosno. The area is also known for its extraordinary natural values. The region is prone to flood risk both in winter and in summer. This includes different types of flooding like freshets, flash floods, pluvial floods, snow-melt floods and floods caused by ice dams on rivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This case study focuses on a specific part of the Upper Vistula areas, namely the area near the town of Sandomierz, in the province of Swietokrzyskie. The area is characterized by several significant tributaries, including San Rive, the largest Carpathian tributary of the Vistula River. In this area, the 2010 devastating floods resulted in 3,000 evacuated people and 4 casualties. Consequently, new initiatives were launched to increase flood protection and the retention capacity of the river basin. These initiatives include a hybrid approach of green and grey infrastructure measures like renaturalisation of reservoirs and wetland restauration; expansion reconstruction and modernization of river embankments; restoration of dike functionalities; and reconstruction of water pump stations and water discharge channels.</p>

Precipitation and run-off in the area are respectively 15% and 50% greater than Poland’s average. Other elements determining high flood vulnerability are: a dense hydrographic network, steep slopes, the oval shape of the catchment area, high road intensity and high population density in the catchment area. Floods are of diverse origin: flash floods caused by intense and short-lived downpours, freshets caused by melting snow, and flood caused by ice dams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several areas of the Upper Vistula region are vulnerable to floods. The highest flood risk is located on the right bank of the Vistula, upstream the town of Sandomierz which is home to about 24,700 people. The floods of May and June 2010 were caused by heavy rainfall and have resulted in collapsed levees in the neighboring area of Sandomierz, affecting this town and the neighboring towns of Tarnobrzeg and Gorzyce. In Sandomierz, an area of 1,154 ha was flooded, corresponding to 40% of its total extension. The area was flooded for about two weeks and the region had a standstill of several months. The flood losses were estimated at approximately EUR 100 million, while 3,000 people were evacuated and 4 died. Then, in July 2011, heavy rainfall caused another flood event, damaging the old town in Sandomierz, road infrastructure, the sewerage network and recreational areas. Total losses amounted to almost EUR 2 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although current flood risk is already high, climate change models indicated that this risk will increase tremendously. In the region of Upper Vistula, the additional area prone to flooding can extend up to 1,751 km<sup>2 </sup>in case of a 1 in 100 year return period flood by 2050, including an additional urban area of 89 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the adaptation measures implemented in the Sandomierz area is to increase the retention capacity and to reduce flood risk in and around this town, also in light of future climate change. Other objectives that were considered in the design of the solutions are: protection of public health and safety, biodiversity conservation, environmental objectives with regard to water quality, protection of soil, landscape and cultural heritage protection, and economic prosperity.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The adopted solution to reduce flood risk and to improve flood protection in the area of Sandomierz is a hybrid and integrated approach of green and grey infrastructure measures, including some institutional measures as well. These solutions were designed within the scope of the Vistula River Management Basin Plans, which are part of the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive and the European Flood Directive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renaturalization of reservoirs and wetland restauration are considered green measures to reduce exposure of people to flooding. These adaptation measures are implemented in 15 locations along the Upper Vistula River and aim to increase the controlled water retention capacity of the area. Indeed, naturalized reservoirs and restored wetlands are used to capture the surplus of river water and therefore to reduce the risk of flooding. These green measures are combined with grey ones: expansion, reconstruction and modernization of river embankments, specifically aimed to further protect urbanized areas from flooding reducing the risk of water overflow. The existing embanked area is enlarged to include the entire area that can be flooded during high water levels. Moreover embankments are raised up to a maximum elevation of 1.4 m, ensuring that embankment crowns along both river banks are adapted to the same safety level. Modernization intervention includes also the (re)construction of water pump stations and water discharge channels, that help to discharge the water in excess.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the adaptation measures is under the competence of the core organisations acting within the river basin of the Upper Vistula: the Regional Water Management authorities of Krakow, Kielce and Rzeszow. These authorities worked closely together with local ones. The green and grey adaptation measures were designed within the scope of the River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) elaborated according to the WFD and the Flood Directive and therefore have been part of the related stakeholder consultation process. Stakeholders have been involved via the informal Public Participation Committee of the Water Management Council. The 20 members of this Committee are elected representatives of various interest groups, like local government authorities, agriculture, fisheries, other economic sectors and ecological organizations as well as water users and water managers. This informal Committee disseminated information about the RBMP to the participating organisations and other interested parties, which had the opportunity to express opinions on draft plans. Stakeholders and citizens could provide input via a first questionnaire to identify the main issues related to flooding characterizing the area. A second questionnaire was aimed to gather input on potential solutions. In addition, seminars and public meetings were organised in the period 2008 – 2009.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major drivers for the implementation of the flood protection measures was the direct experience of local communities being affected by recent floods (2010 and 2011). This has contributed to increase the sense of urgency for the implementation of measures contributing to cope with the flooding challenges. The EU Water Framework and the Flood Directives also played an important role in initiating the integrated process aiming to reduce the flood risk. As alternative to traditional measures, these Directives have been also relevant in promoting green measures aiming to increase the retention capacity of the area while respecting their natural values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction the natural value of the area had to be maintained. Therefore, the impact on natural habitats and habitats of species for community interest, according to Natura 2000 policies, had to be monitored. Another factor affecting the measure implementation is changes in land entitlement that had to be organised in order to expand the embankments.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total cost of the adaptation measures implemented in the Sandomierz area is about EUR 217 million. This includes costs incurred to implement the expansion, reconstruction and modernisation of the river embankments (grey measures) as well as the renaturalisation of reservoirs and wetland restauration (green measures), including the needed land purchases. Funds for implementing these measures were requested and received from the World Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The avoided flood damage to buildings (5,632 buildings in total) was estimated to be about EUR 445 million in constant values. Taking into account only this estimate, and therefore not considering impacts on people, the benefit-cost ratio is 2.05, implying that expected benefits are at least approximately twice larger than costs (DHI Polska, 2013, Raport z opracowania programu działań dla Regionu Wodnego Górnej Wisły, Report KZGW/ DpiZE-op/POPT/1/2013, DHI Polska, Warsaw, Poland; <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/green-infrastructure-and-flood-management">EEA, 2017</a>).</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation measures have been implemented within the scope of the EU Water Framework and Flood Directives that are both transposed into the national Water Law. The implementation of the adaptation measures required the application of the due procedures of environmental impact assessment. The formulation of mitigating measures to prevent environmental and social impacts is in particular important within the scope of the received World Bank funding for construction.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the plan originates from 2011, during the process of elaboration of the 1<sup>st</sup> River Basin Management Plan. The plan, including the measures was finalized in 2015. Implementation of the described measures is currently taking place and is expected to be completed by 2019.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Implementation of the integrated Master Plan for Coastal Safety in Flanders]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Flemish coast is intensively used by many actors. A safety test of the coastal defences showed that about one third of the coastline together with parts of the harbours are not sufficiently protected against severe storm events, being minimally for a 1000-year event under current conditions and when taking into account a sea level rise of 30 cm in 2050. In 2007, the Flemish Government started the elaboration of an Integrated Master Plan for Coastal Safety that was eventually approved by the Flemish Government in June 2011.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Flemish coastline is 67 km long and consists mostly of sandy beaches. The coastline is intensively used including ten coastal towns and cities, protected with a sea wall. Among these, Zeebrugge and Oostende hosts important commercial ports with connected industrial areas. The same cities, together with Nieuwpoort and Blankenberge, are also the location of important recreational marinas. Besides human activities, Flemish coast also includes valuable natural areas, such as the tidal inlet at the border with the Netherlands, called the Zwin. Moreover, low-lying polders in the hinterland form a 15 km wide flood prone area where about 400.000 people live.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">A study conducted by the Coastal Division (part of the Agency for Maritime Services and Coast – Flemish Government) identified vulnerable points in the coastal defence and showed that about one third of Flemish coastline is not sufficiently protected against severe storm events (i.e. those with a probability of 0.1% per year). Sea level rise and other climate change related effects (such as change in storm and precipitation intensity and frequency) can exacerbate this vulnerability.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Improve defences of the Flemish coastline to the level of protection against extreme storm events at 1:1000 years return period, including under a +30 cm sea level rise by 2050, together with a sustainable management.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Include societal participation and involvement of stakeholders to find balances in environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational objectives within the boundaries of the natural dynamics of the coast.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">In March 2007 the Coastal Division initiated an Integrated Master Plan for Coastal Safety (<em>Masterplan Kustveiligheid</em>) to protect Flanders against extreme flooding events in the present and in the future (2050). Extreme flooding events were defined as those associated with storms with a 1:1000 years return period. The Master Plan aims to ensure the same level of protection under current conditions and in the case of a +30 cm sea level rise by 2050.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Before the Master Plan was finalised, an emergency plan for the execution of most critical works was in place between 2004-2010. This made it possible to resolve most pressing problems and cover short-term risks that were mapped by a study that was part of the Master Plan elaboration. In particular implemented emergency measures have provided protection against storms with 1:100 years return period as a minimum along the entire coastline.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The Flemish government approved the Master Plan for Coastal Safety on the 10th of June 2011, after it was approved by the ten Flemish coastal cities and coastal communities. The Master Plan includes both soft and hard measures. Soft measures consist of beach and dune nourishment. The permit granted by the Federal Government enables to extract about 20 million cubic meters of sand – taken from the Belgian part of the North Sea – over a period of 10 years, thus fully supporting beach and dune nourishment. Beaches and dunes are monitored every year to adapt their management accordingly. Beach nourishment is managed using a 5-year plan in order to respond to still occurring erosion and cope with future sea level rise; the volumes needed for maintenance are estimated around 500.000 cubic meters per year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The Master Plan also foresees the construction of storm walls to protect coastal cities and harbours (hard measures). An optimal design of these hard protection measures has been designed to minimise their height and optimise their spatial integration. For the harbour of Nieuwpoort, the construction of a storm surge barrier at the harbour entrance was also considered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Works started in 2011, after the Master Plan approval. The ambition is to protect the critical area’s as soon as possible. The website Kustveiligheid (Coastal Safety; <span style="color: black; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-font-kerning: .5pt; mso-fareast-language: HI; mso-bidi-language: HI; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><a href="http://www.kustveiligheid.be/">www.kustveiligheid.be</a></span>) provides information on specific measures planned in each coastal community as well as the relative work progress. At end 2013, planned beach nourishments have been completed in the following focus areas: De Panne, Koksijde – St.Idesbald, De Haan - Wenduine, Ostend centre; emergency beach nourishments have been executed in Knokke-Heist. The beach nourishments between Ostend-centre and Ostend – Raversijde is in progress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The city of Ostend represents one example of coastal city at risk. The city is protected by a sea wall that was built 140 years ago. Over the years, the sea wall accelerated the erosion of the beach in front of that same wall. In 2004, an emergency beach nourishment was undertaken, increasing the level of protection up to the level of a storm with a return period of 1:100 years. On-going and planned works will ensure Ostend protection to standards defined by the Master Plan. These measures include the creation of a larger beach. In the central area of the city this beach will be stabilised by a new harbour dam which was built perpendicular to the coastline at the north eastern side of the new beach. It is expected that the new harbour dam will reduce the requirement for maintenance of beach nourishment to once every five to ten years. Coastal protection of Ostend has been combined with the harbour improvement plan and additional projects, including renovation of the sea promenade and an underground parking.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During the elaboration of the Master Plan particular attention was given to communication and stakeholder participation (including questionnaire, presentations, brochures, newsletter, etc.). Stakeholders’ consultation was in particular carried out by means of a steering committee and an advisory board. The steering committee consists of representatives of different governments and administrations at provincial, Flemish and Belgian levels. The advisory board consists of direct and local stakeholders, like representatives of: the coastal communities and towns, nature organisations, yacht clubs, beach clubs and the local economy including <em>horeca</em> (hotel, restaurant and catering). The same consultation bodies are also involved during the implementation phase of the Master Plan measures. Moreover, a communication programme is developed, including information targeted at the broad public on work progress and the publication of the website Kustveiligheid (Coastal Safety; <span style="color: black; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 8.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-font-kerning: .5pt; mso-fareast-language: HI; mso-bidi-language: HI; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><a href="http://www.kustveiligheid.be/">www.kustveiligheid.be</a></span>), that provides information on specific measures planned in each coastal community as well as the relative work progress.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Master Plan clearly identifies most critical areas of the coastal system, enabling optimisation of the use of resources and focusing on real priorities. Other success factors are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Adoption of an integrated approach, based on the integration between soft (beach and dune nourishment) and hard (storm return walls, broadening of seawalls with stilling wave basin, storm surge barrier) protection measures;</li>
<li>As part of the integrated approach, a combination of protection measures with local requalification interventions, such as in the case of the city of Ostend, where coastal protection was integrated with the harbour improvement, the renovation of the seaside promenade and the construction of underground parking;</li>
<li>Adoption of a dual temporal vision, including both the short term view that aimed to improve the protection of currently critical areas and a long-term view (2050) aimed at providing the desired level of protection even in the future.</li>
<li>Wide stakeholder participation, during both the design and implementation phases of the Master Plan.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The coastal protection Master Plan is rather ambitious and therefore requires continuous engagement and technical-financial support. This is required in the future so as not to limit the full implementation of identified measures. Particular attentions is also intended to be given to monitoring and assessment of potential ecological effects of planned interventions, including beach nourishment in particular.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The total investment cost by the Flemish Government of the Master Plan for Coastal Safety is about 300 million euros. This estimation does not include costs related to the architectural development of hard protection measures aiming to preserve or even improve the local architectural and recreational values. This costs are covered by coastal municipalities. Maintenance costs of the new beaches (i.e. conservation of safety conditions after beach and dune nourishment) is around 8 million euros per year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Principal benefits are related to the main Master Plan goal, i.e. to protect coastal communities against storm events with a yearly probability of 0.1%, under current condition and the case of sea level rise (up to 30 cm by 2050). Coastal protection implies the maintenance of coastal human actives, including in particular: residential use of the coastal space, tourism, harbour and industrial activities. Wider beaches and the design of sea walls that optimises their integration in the existing coastal space will likely generate benefits in terms of tourism.</p>

    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kruikeke Bazel Rupelmonde (KBR) Controlled Flood Area (CFA) is a key component of the Belgian <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/../viewmeasure?ace_measure_id=5002"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 9.0pt; mso-ascii-font-family: Verdana; mso-hansi-font-family: Verdana;">Sigma Plan for the Scheldt Estuary</span></a></span>. The Sigma Plan is an integrated flood protection plan that combines dykes, seawalls and flood areas to protect approximately 20,000 hectares of land from flooding. Within the Sigma Plan, the KBR site is the most important Controlled Flood Area, and it is projected to reduce flood risks along the Scheldt Estuary by five times. To create the KBR area, works were carried out to open three contiguous polders (areas of reclaimed land) – the Kruibeke, Bazel and Rupelmonde Polders – to controlled tidal action. Construction started soon after 2000 and in late 2014 it was nearing completion: the final step is the disputed move of an industrial pipeline to allow the new, inner dike to be closed and the CFA to become operational.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[controlled flood areas, Bazel, Rupelmonde, Sigma Plan, Scheldt estuary, nature compensation, Kruibeke]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The KBR CFA is a keystone project within the Sigma plan and its largest CFA. The Sigma Plan was designed in response to the storm surge disaster of 1976. During this storm, a dike broke at Ruisbroek, upstream from the KBR site, flooding this town and surrounding lands and requiring the evacuation of more than 2000 people. Due to climate change, such extreme weather events are expected to occur more frequently in coming decades. Measurements already show that the occurrence of storm surge floods as measured at Antwerp have increased significantly since the 1950s. The KBR CFA will provide a large storage area for water during storm surge events, thereby reducing the risks of floods along the Scheldt estuary.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary objective of the KBR Controlled Flood Area is to reduce flood risks along the Scheldt and its main tributaries, including in the perspective of climate change and sea-level rise. The KBR CFA should by itself increase current the protection level from floods occurring once every 70 years to once every 350 years. With the addition of ongoing and future Sigma Plan projects, the minimum level of flood protection throughout the Scheldt estuary will be improved further so that flood events are projected to occur only once every 1000 years, taking into account a sea level rise of 25cm by 2050.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The secondary objective of the KBR is to provide nature compensation for the expansion of the Port of Antwerp Harbour and for large infrastructure works taking place in the Scheldt Estuary: the site’s nature compensation area includes 150 hectares of bird meadow area for works related to the port’s Deurganck Dock and 300 hectares of tidal marshland for Scheldt infrastructure works.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kruikeke Bazel Rupelmonde (KBR) Controlled Flood Area was created by lowering the height of the former flood protection dykes along the Scheldt and constructing new dykes further inland at the appropriate flood protection height (called the Sigma height). As of mid-2014, the new inland dykes were near completion with only a small gap still to be constructed. The outer dykes have already been lowered to serve as overflow dykes, though in places some further reductions are planned. Once the area is put into operation, it is expected that the exceptional tides (‘leap’ or ‘spring’ tides) and storm surges will overflow the outer dykes an average of once or twice a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The KBR site will provide a major contribution to flood safety along the Scheldt estuary due to its large size, 600 hectares, its strategic location and the low level of the land, ensuring a large water storage capacity. The KBR controlled flood area consists of what were originally three separate, contiguous polders (areas of reclaimed land), the Kruibeke, Bazel and Rupelmonde Polders. These polders were used predominantly for agricultural and recreational purposes such as fish ponds. While these functions could be conserved to a large degree within a controlled flooding area, it was instead decided to convert the area into a nature area as compensation for areas affected by port expansion and work in the Scheldt River. This choice to develop nature within the CFA reflects the integrated approach of the Sigma Plan, which combines flood protection and nature protection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Already prior to the project, the three Polders were designated as Special Protection Zones under the Habitats Directive, based in particular on the presence of priority habitats of ‘remaining relict woods on alluvial grounds’. Furthermore, with the project the Polders were indicated as protected under the Birds Directive. To create the required compensation for natural areas affected by the Port of Antwerp, 300 hectares of tidal marshes, 150 hectares of meadow bird area and 91.9 hectares of forest were planned within the Controlled Flood Area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of creating tidal marshes, several weirs have been inserted in the outer dyke to allow a controlled tide within the CFA once the inland dyke is finalised. The system allows water from the Scheldt to flow into the area through high weirs during high tide and exit the area during low tide through low weirs. The high weirs are important as they allow the effects of high and neap tides to occur within the KBR CFA. Furthermore, the combination of outlet and inlet weirs allows for a regular exchange of organisms and nutrients between the Controlled Flood Area and the Scheldt. One low weir will be kept open on a nearly permanent basis to allow a continual exchange of water between the Scheldt and the Kruibeekse Creek, to support fish migration. The weirs are also essential for removing excess water from the CFA after storm surge events that overtop the outer dykes (and they can be used prior to an expected storm surge event in order to maximize the water catchment capacity of the CFA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other natural areas within the CFA are woods and meadow bird areas. As of mid-2014, the meadow bird areas are awaiting a management regime that will ensure that the vegetation remains hospitable to nesting birds. The woods provide compensation for forest areas due to the construction of the inland dyke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of works just outside of the KBR CFA have also been undertaken, including the creation of a small area of depoldered land along the Scheldt River just in front of the outer dyke of the CFA and two water catchment areas on the landward side of the inner dykes. The depoldered area has been exposed fully to the tide as dyke protection has been moved further inland, creating a tidal wetland.  The two catchment areas were created to store water from the creeks that during normal operation flow through the CFA. During storm surge events, the creeks will not be able to flow into the CFA as the weirs through which the creeks usually flow will be closed, and these catchment areas were built to temporarily store their water. The Northern catchment area has been developed into a recreational area with several fish ponds and a walking path.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the project has integrated recreational functions throughout the site, including paths for hiking and biking, educational signposts, an observation tower and recreational fishing opportunities.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation has been an essential part of the KBR project. Local opposition started after the project was announced in 1977 as part of the first Sigma Plan, leading to many years of delay. By the end of the last century, while all other original Sigma Plan projects were already completed, work on the KBR CFA had not yet begun. In 1998 a newspaper headline characterised the opposition position as “Wie de Polder Raakt, zal storm oogsten” (i.e. “who touches the polder, will harvest a storm”). Opposition arose from safety concerns expressed by the Kruibeke municipal government, concerns from environmental NGOs about the zoning plan and resistance from farmers and fishing pond owners in the KBR site who did not wish to be expropriated. Protests against the project were organized every Tuesday for several years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To address this significant opposition, the Flanders government gave extra attention to stakeholder relations and project communication. Attention was directed at specific stakeholder groups including: farmers, nature enthusiasts, municipalities and local residents. Efforts were made to nurture relationships with these stakeholder groups and to achieve broader support from Kruibeke residents by providing them steady updates on the project. Over time the project managed to garner stakeholder support and (following legal action) to expropriate nearly all the land within the polders. Local citizen support was improved through the integration of recreational opportunities for local citizens and others as well as steps to address specific project concerns. The recreational opportunities were also considered to potentially offer new business opportunities through increased tourism. By 2014, local support had increased following changes in the municipal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this process, the designation of the site as a nature compensation area for the Port of Antwerp raised the project’s political profile and provided an impetus to reach an agreement and begin work in 2001.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In late 2014, while nearly all local public and stakeholder issues had been resolved and the project was near completion, one issue continued to block completion. Several pipelines that ran through the polders have had to be rerouted in order to finish the dyke works. Under a 2004 Royal Decree, the owners of the pipelines were required to pay for these works themselves. While three of the pipeline owners rerouted their pipelines, one multinational company has refused to pay for the rerouting of their industrial pipelines, thereby delaying completion of the inner dyke. The Flemish government has initiated legal procedures against this company. Once a resolution can be found, the last piece of dyke can be constructed and the area can become operational.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The project creates a large integrated and multi-functional area that will provide flood safety, natural habitats and recreational space.</li>
<li>A lengthy process of communication and relationship building with local communities and stakeholders helped to reverse much of the opposition to the project. Communication emphasised the project’s functions for local safety and also for recreation.</li>
<li>Linking the project to compensation for natural areas affected by the port helped to raise its political profile.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these elements, it should be noted that both political and legal processes, including the expropriation of private land, have been lengthy, with close to 40 years elapsing between the initial proposal and its (near) completion.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The budget for the development of the KBR CFA was 100 million, and with the project nearing completition it remains within budget. Approximately three-quarters of the budget was used for studies and construction and one-quarter for expropriating landowners. To carry out the project, more than 100 separate contracts were awarded. For more information about costs and benefits, please see the Sigma Plan case study.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The nature compensation projects that are a central element of the KBR project are linked to the EU Habitats and Birds Directives. The construction of Deurganck Dock in the Port of Antwerp required the compensation of 150 hectares of bird meadow area, while other infrastructural works related to the Antwerp harbour required the compensation of 300 hectares of natural tidal nature areas within the KBR CFA. The compensation works in the KBR CFA related to the Deurganck Dock were mandated by the Flemish Parliament in an Emergency Decree of 14 December 2001.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Moor protection in the Allgäu region (Germany) through a stakeholder-based approach]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">“Allgäuer Moorallianz” is an initiative which was founded in 2007 aiming to foster moor protection in the Allgäu region. The Allgäu region belongs to the Bavarian Alpine foreland (Germany) and hosts one of the most important hotspots of high wetland with its diversity of moor types existing across the young moraine landscape and at different elevation levels. The conservation of these moor landscapes has a significant effect on reducing climate change impacts and maintain ecosystem services such as climate regulation. The conservation activities of “Allgäuer Moorallianz” help to secure the continued existence of fen and bog habitats part of the mire landscape under changing climate conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall aim of this initiative is to counter biodiversity loss by protecting and restoring the Allgäu mire landscape. The options and implemented measures of the Moorallianz provide good examples for synergies between nature conservation, regional development and climate change adaptation.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Allgäu mire landscape comprises a mosaic of endangered bog and fen habitats along different altitudinal levels. One of the main challenges to halting rapid biodiversity loss is to diminish isolation effects and further develop the connectivity between these wetland mosaics. Climate change is expected to seriously amplify existing threats to mire landscape and its endangered species and habitats protected under the Habitats Directive. Habitat connectivity will become even more significant under changing climate conditions. The increasing temperatures and the associated changes in the habitat conditions will displace especially cold-adapted species. Glacial relict remnants (e.g. the “<em>Colias Palaeno</em> - moorland clouded yellow”, a butterfly on the Red List of threatened species Germany) strongly rely on the connectivity of wetland habitats to be able to shift to higher altitudes. That is why the bog and fen habitats of the Allgäu region along different elevation levels can provide a chance of survival for these climate-vulnerable species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moor habitat types depend on hydrological conditions and this means these habitats are directly and indirectly connected with the climate. Until the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (2071-2100) the mean temperature is expected to increase of about +3.2°C under the emission scenario RCP8.5 in Bavaria. This will lead to change in species composition and distribution. Furthermore, due to this warmer temperatures a longer (growing season) is expected (being up to 57 days longer by end of the 21<sup>st </sup>century) (<a href="http://www.regionaler-klimaatlas.de" target="_blank" data-linktype="external" data-val="http://www.regionaler-klimaatlas.de">regionaler-klimaatlas.de</a>). The extended vegetation period will result in higher water requirement of plants with negative effects on the moor water balance.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall aim of the “Allgäuer Moorallianz” initiative is to counter biodiversity loss by protecting and restoring the Allgäu moor landscape, in close integration with sustainable regional development. The establishment of suitable economic conditions for regional stakeholders (e.g. those involved in agriculture, forestry and tourism sectors) is highly relevant to ensure a long-term conservation approach. “Allgäuer Moorallianz” aims at establishing a stable cooperation between landscape management, nature conservation and regional economic development. This requires a strong commitment among all stakeholders involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> “Allgäuer Moorallianz” stresses the importance of the ecosystem services (such as water quality and quantity regulation) provided by the Allgäuer moor landscape, including in particular its contribution to the reduction of climate change impacts. The initiative also aims at strengthening the resilience of endangered bog and fen habitats and related species (e.g. by maintaining habitat connectivity) as well as at maintaining ecosystem services under changing climate condition.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to establish a sustainable conservation strategy for bogs and near-natural moor woodlands the close cooperation with regional actors - particularly farmers and landowners - is crucial. In the Allgäu region traditional forms of extensive agriculture relevant for an intact moor landscape are still in practice. This offers good opportunities for the stakeholder-based approach adopted by the “Allgäuer Moorallianz” initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Allgäuer Moorallianz” is mainly funded by a large-scale nature conservation project (2009-2022), under the funding scheme <em>chance.natur </em>(for more details see the section “Cost and Benefits”<em>)</em>. The overall project area includes more than 185,000 ha, located in two administrative districts (the Oberallgäu and the Ostallgäu, both with a population density of around 100/km<sup>2</sup>). Within this region landscape management, education, tourism and awareness building measures have been implemented or supported by the Moorallianz aiming at integrating moor protection with regional development and tourism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009 the large-scale nature conservation project started with a so-called development phase. During the first four years “Allgäuer Moorallianz” conducted a process to set up a development plan (PEPL - Pflege und Entwicklungsplan). The aim of the development plan was to get an overview of mire areas valuable to nature conservation and possible strategies to preserve and improve them. As a first step, a moor inventory of species and habitats and a water balance assessment were carried out. With this knowledge Moorallianz developed primary objectives and possible measures for different habitat types and endangered species; these are listed below together with the extension of the area they apply to as defined by the PEPL:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Maintaining and improving the status of near-natural bogs and bog woodlands: 535.7 ha;</li>
<li>Restoration of degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration: 2,315.7 ha;</li>
<li>Extensive management of near-natural open-land habitats and forests: 1,680 ha;</li>
<li>Keep fallow areas open in near-natural open-land habitats and forests: 485 ha;</li>
<li>Restoration (after fallowness) of extensive grassland: 310 ha;</li>
<li>Long-term management of extensive grassland: 1,115 ha;</li>
<li>Conservation of a grassland buffer zone: 280 ha.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012 the PEPL was finalised and the implementation phase of the large-scale nature conservation project started with a term of 10 years. As the implementation of the entire, wide-ranging PEPL is not possible during this time period, focus areas have been defined in close cooperation with all stakeholders (landowners and stakeholders from the agriculture, forestry and tourism sectors). Identified priorities mirror three different types of measure:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Hydrological restoration (e.g. re-wet formerly drained bogs);</li>
<li>Prevention of eutrophication; and</li>
<li>Landscape management measures (e.g. keep up the traditional mowing to save meadow habitats of high biodiversity in the surrounding area or traditional forms of extensive bog forest management).</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Between 2012 and 2017 the Moorallianz initiative was able to purchase around 180 ha of raised and low bog areas implementing regeneration or landscape conservation management measures. Until the end of the large-scale nature conservation project in 2022 the Moorallianz will continuously buy bog habitat area and extend nature conservation measures. The “Seemoos” bog area provides an example of implemented measure. This degraded bog landscape used to be drained by many ditches with a total length of 12 km. These ditches are now dammed up again, so that the water can be held in the bog area. The “Seemoos” is one of the degraded bogs still capable of natural regeneration with a very high restoration potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these measures, the initiative also focuses on awareness-raising and environmental education. Together with regional partners Allgäuer Moorallianz started a “Moor campaign” presenting the importance of the Allgäuer moors area as a formative element of the local landscape. This campaign includes activities such as: a circulating moor exhibition, provision of educational material and excursions for schools and youth groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The nature conservation measures of “Allgäuer Moorallianz” give highly endangered habitats and specialized moorland species (such as glacial relict remnants) a chance to survive also under the expected changing climate conditions. Another co-benefit of the moor conservation in the Allgäu region is the maintenance and improvement of moor ecosystem services such as climate regulation, provisioning of water, water purification and cultural services (recreation).</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Allgäuer Moorallianz” initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors. Nature conservation experts and activists are one of the key drivers for the initiative and aim to halt biodiversity loss by establishing long-term moor protection and restoration activities. Farmers and landowners play an important role for habitat management on the other side. Many of the endangered high biodiversity habitats (e.g. meadows) rely on sustainable management and therefore suitable economic conditions for traditional farming methods need to be established. Besides nature conservation objectives, the protection of the unique wetland landscape is supported by the communal tourism offices, as tourism in the region also relies on the unique value of the moor landscape. The cooperation between these different stakeholders is a central pillar of the Moorallianz initiative. Establishing cooperation between these stakeholder groups was and still is a complex process and one of the main challenges for the management of the initiative.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Factors decisive for a successful outcome of the Moorallianz initiative:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Cooperation among actors from nature conservation, agriculture and tourism, which is essential for the establishment of long-term moor protection and management;</li>
<li>Focus on long-term moor conservation and restauration strategies (such as purchasing bog area or supporting farmers in purchasing agricultural machinery promoting the preservation of traditional extensive agriculture);</li>
<li>Awareness-raising among all stakeholders and the public;</li>
<li>Promoting the understanding of the unique moor landscape and its ecosystem services.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The overarching objectives of this large-scale nature conservation project are: create a long-term perspective for moor conservation, halt biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem services under changing climate conditions. In addition to promoting traditional agriculture, awareness-raising and cooperation among different stakeholders, land purchase is one important strategy for a long-term perspective in nature conservation. Here, the Moorallianz faces many challenges:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>For historical reasons, land ownership in this region is very fragmented (moor premises have an average size of about 0.15 ha per landowner). Due to this fact, Moorallianz must contact and negotiate with many landowners who have very different interests.</li>
<li>Intensification of agriculture, settlement pressure and infrastructure projects lead to land-use conflicts, also on bogs and fens habitats (especially in peripheral areas).</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, in order to secure the long-term perspective, efforts beyond the current project duration (2009-2022) are necessary.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">“Allgäuer Moorallianz” is mainly funded by two projects:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>A large-scale nature conservation project <em>(</em>2009-2022) implemented under the funding scheme <a href="https://www.bmu.de/themen/natur-biologische-vielfalt-arten/naturschutz-biologische-vielfalt/foerderprogramme/chancenatur/"><em>chance.natur</em></a><em>,</em> with a total budget of around EUR 9.4 million (75% provided by German national funding, 15% by the Federal State of Bavaria and 10% by project supporters).</li>
<li>An associated rural development project implemented under the “Ländliche Entwicklung” agricultural, tourism and regional economy funding regime from 2009 to 2016, which had a funding budget of about EUR 1.4 million.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, bog protection measures are being funded by landscape maintenance programmes and contractual nature conservation agreements within regular programmes of the State of Bavaria. Finally, several mire protection projects in the Allgäu region are receiving funding from the Bavarian “KLIP 2050 program” (Bavarian Climate Protection Program 2050).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiative has implemented many important long-term conservation measures for a large area with endangered wetland habitats and species so far. An important co-benefit of this project is the successful awareness building process among the regional stakeholders as well as the local population. The wetland and moor landscape in the Allgäu region - and its ecosystem services - have become an important value for parts of the local community as well as for tourism.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">“Allgäuer Moorallianz” is organised as an association which is held by two administrative districts in Bavaria (Landkreis Ostallgäu and Landkreis Oberallgäu).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project area of the Allgäuer Moorallianz includes eleven Natura 2000 sites comprising many Natura 2000 bog and wetland habitats as well as species protected under the Habitat Directive. This has acted as an important driver to design and implement measures aiming to the long-term conservation of the moor landscape.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The elaboration of the PEPL plan started in 2009 and was completed in 2012. After the plan finalisation concrete implementation of protection and restoration measures was initiated and is planned to continue to 2022.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Nature-based measures against rockfalls over forests in the Engadin Region, Switzerland]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forests can provide effective protection against rockfalls, landslides and avalanches; their preservation and proper management can maintain these services and functions which assume relevance also in the perspective of adaptation to current extreme events and future climate changes. The Protect Bio method enables the evaluation of these ecosystem services. The method aims to evaluate if technical protective (and expensive) measures (i.e. technical structures) need to be implemented in forests to provide protection against rockfalls or if forests can naturally prevent damages caused by these events. The method was implemented in practice for the first time in a protection forest (i.e. forests which are maintained for protective functions) on the Fuorn Pass road in the Engadin region, Switzerland. The Protect Bio method enabled to promote the forest protection function as an effective adaptation measure to cope with natural hazards typical of mountain regions.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[rockfall, forest management, forest conservation, risk map, Biological protective measures]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forests are particularly vulnerable to extreme events. Compared with the slow processes in the forest (growth, seed distribution, genetic adaptability, etc.), climate change threatens to occur at a rate that overwhelms natural adaptation processes. Important forest products and services such as protection against natural hazards could be reduced or disappear due to climate change. Alpine forest ecosystems are already affected from multiple climate-induced effects, e.g. higher tree mortality, more pest species calamities, higher water stress and greater forest fire frequency, thus reducing the role of forests to protect against rockfalls, landslides and avalanches. For example, major outbreaks of bark beetles were observed in protection forests in Switzerland, resulting from the Lothar winter storm in 1999 and the dry summer in 2003. Such outbreaks had never occurred at this altitude before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As reported in the EEA report “<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/climate-change-impacts-and-vulnerability-2016">Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe</a>”, the main climatic drivers affecting Alpine forests are: (i) an increase in temperature higher than the global average; from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Alpine region experienced a total annual mean temperature increase of about 2 °C, nearly twice the average in the northern hemisphere, (ii) an observed increase in annual precipitation in the north-west and a decrease in the south-east of the Alps, (iii) a pronounced variability in precipitation patterns (i.e. a decrease in seasonal precipitation during summer and increase in precipitation in winter in the north-west), as well as change in the intensity of extreme weather events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A general shift in precipitation peaks from summer to winter is projected for most of the Alps, while the south and south-east will become significantly drier in all seasons. Moreover, an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events (heavy rainfall, drought periods, heat waves and possibly also storms) is expected in the whole Alpine region, leading to have the hydrological system of forests more sensitive to extreme weather events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, other than climate related hazards, such as gravitational mass movements (e.g. debris flows and landslides), torrential processes and floods, Alpine forests are highly susceptible to related climate effects, such as increased soil erosion, permafrost degradation and destabilization of mountain slopes. Extreme events, such as intense precipitation and storms, could then determine an increased risk of rock falls and landslide in such a degraded soil and with forest under stress conditions. This reduces the suitable areas for settlement, reinforcing the competition between the different forms of land use and directly affecting infrastructures for transport and energy distribution. Rockfall risk – from bits of gravel to fist-sized rocks which can penetrate a car roof – also requires to regularly clearing the carriageway. Marks on the asphalt and repaired areas also bear witness to such events. In the Fuorn Pass road in Engadin region in Switzerland, the potential initiation area in the massive fissured rock faces over the pass road extends from around 600 m to 2,100 m asl. The slope in this area partly exceeds 45 degrees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures should reduce existing risks, increase adaptability through carefully planned regeneration of the forest species and reduce future risks. The fields of action identified include the critical protection of forests with a protective function in which there is a combination of insufficient regeneration (i.e. climate change occurs at a rate that overwhelms natural adaptation processes compared with the slow processes in the forest, such as plant growth, seed distribution, genetic adaptability, etc.) and reduced stability.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forests provide more effective protection against natural hazards than even experts in the field believed up to now. Maintaining forests is considerably cheaper than building costly technical structures. But can the forest guarantee a similar level of safety to structural measures? The Protect Bio method enables the evaluation of this nature-based protection service. As part of this project, a method was developed which makes it possible to determine the effect of the forest and other biological protection measures and to take them into account accurately in hazard protection projects. This method aims to evaluate the forest protection functions against natural hazards or the need for implementing technical protective measures (i.e. barriers or nets) to prevent from rockfalls damages. The method was used in practice for the first time on Fuorn Pass road, which connects Zernez in the Engadin valley with Val Müstair.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Fuorn Pass road, near Zernez in the Engadin region (Switzerland), is an approximately 800-metre-long stretch of road. Rockfall risk in this area was analysed with the help of the Protect Bio method. Rockfalls events registered in the past, maps of past events and scenarios derived from the structural geological observations allow describing the rockfall risk: the analysis shows the areas in which rockfall may be expected and how frequently such events may arise. A mathematical model was also used to simulate the consequences of the rockfall events. Based on a three-dimensional terrain model the computer calculates the rockfall track and the forces released by different rock and boulder sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Protect Bio method also enables to take in consideration in the risk assessment the role of biological protective measures provided by forests against natural hazards (rockfalls, landslides, avalanches, etc.). The site gradient, stem density and other factors are incorporated into the simulation for the determination of the forest’s protection capacity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Fuorn Pass road near Zernez, results showed that no rockfall nets are needed on around half of the affected stretch of road. In this portion, the protection function provided by existing forests is enough to ensure protection against events with less than 1 to 30 years return period. As a low-cost complementary measure, felled trees can be arranged crossways to the slope. Technical and more expensive measures (such as nets) are only needed in stretches of the road where the forest is thin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on previous assessments – in which the insufficiently quantifiable effect of the protection forest as a natural impediment was often ignored – rockfall nets or other protective barriers would have had to be built along most of the stretch of road in question. With the Protect Bio method, the forest protection function has been evaluated and promoted as adaptation measure based on accurate risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. The application of this method, thus, allowed saving millions of euros on technical protective structures that have been evaluated as not necessary.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The developed method includes different tools and analytical approach which make it possible to determine the effect of the forest and other biological protection measures and to take them into account accurately in hazard protection projects, saving costs associated to the implementation of not necessary technical protective structures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the role of protection forest services against natural hazards such as avalanches, landslides and debris flows, are rather difficult to assess and quantify; data are not available in every locations.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Around half of Switzerland's forest area is classified as protection forest. Protection forests were neglected for decades until an approach based on the revised forestry legislation introduced in 1991 obliged the cantons to provide for the maintenance of the protection forests. Protection forest was defined as “a forest that can prevent a recognized potential damage due to an existing natural hazard or reduce the associated risks”. Since then the federal authorities, cantons and communes have provided annual funding of around EUR 145 million for the maintenance of protection forests. This represents a good investment, since the economic value of the protection forest, which is related to the risk reduction for settlements and traffic routes, is estimated at EUR 3.8 billion per year.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The consistent use of Protect Bio throughout Switzerland could enable savings millions of euros of technical protective structures; this increases the value of the protection forest still further.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A milestone in the use of natural resources was reached in the 19<sup>th</sup> century with the decision to introduce sustainable management practices to protect forests. Today, Swiss forest legislation is internationally recognised and regulates in a comprehensive manner the various functions of the forest both for people and as a habitat for animals and plants. By encouraging natural and sustainable forest management, it also ensures that wood, a local natural resource, can be used on a permanent basis. Furthermore, the Forest Act (ForA) addresses the key role of forests in protecting against natural hazards. The ForA accords forest a unique position in land use: it protects it both in terms of its spread and its spatial distribution. The main instrument is the general prohibition of deforestation. Besides protecting the forest and the various functions they provide, the ForA also has the goal of managing the forest with respect to nature and of encouraging the sustainable use of wood as a natural resource.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floods, avalanches, landslides and rockfalls frequently occur in Switzerland, and they are often of considerable magnitude. The Hydraulic Engineering Act (HEA) and the ForA regulate how to organise protection against these natural hazards, which is demanded to the cantons. In constructing protective structures and drawing up natural hazard maps, they can call on expert and financial support from the Confederation. The various measures are designed to protect people and valuable property. The best way to do this is to use space appropriately. Spatial planning has to ensure that no buildings or infrastructure are constructed in areas which are prone to natural hazards. Protective forests are also considered a mean to improve protection against avalanches, rockfalls and landslides.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Protect Bio is a pioneering approach developed in Switzerland. Besides the Fuorn Pass road, the method has been implemented for example at Gruobenwald, Klosters and Orvin, Täsch, Schmitten. It is planned to use Protect Bio in other locations and, in particular, in the context of avalanches, rockfall and mudflows in the years to come and to improve its validation.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Optimization of the mix of private and public funding to realise climate adaptation measures in Malmö]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Malmö is experiencing negative effects from climate change due to rising temperatures and excessive rainfall. The city therefore aims to realise climate adaptation measures by integrating it directly in the design of urban development projects, such as in the case of the Western Harbour. The private funding to realise these measures is provided by developers, who realise the actual construction of the projects. They engage in a stakeholder partnership process initiated by the city to ensure that the final realisation of the urban development reflects Malmö’s sustainable vision. The city can initiate an application for additional public funding to finance additional environmental measures and reach a higher level of standard. National and European funding was used in the majority of the Western Harbour development. By applying the stakeholder partnership process, the city gets a good sense of the developer’s plans. This in turn allows the city to realise a more effective investment of public and private funding.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Malmö is experiencing negative effects of climate change due to rising temperatures and excessive rainfall. Consequently the city has had to deal with various flood-related problems since the early 1990s. The most problematic issue has been the frequent overflow of sewage systems, which was for example addressed through a sustainable design for the quarter Augustenborg, involving stakeholder partnership. At the end of the 1990s Malmö was faced with a large economic shift. Traditionally the city’s economy depended largely on its shipyard and heavy industries. The closure of the shipyard due to a financial crisis presented an opportunity to transform the local economy. The city therefore set-out to make the shift from an industrial city to a sustainable and knowledge based city. This transition has resulted in Malmö being considered one of the world’s most sustainable cities today. Still, the city continues to improve by facing its largest challenges today; cloudburst adaptation, social inequality and the housing deficit.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The economic shift led to large internal works within the municipality in the 1990s and ambition to realise 3 major investments; the Øresund Bridge connecting Malmö to Copenhagen in 2001, the creation of Malmö University in 1998 and the redevelopment of Western Harbour since 2001.The Western Harbour district was to be developed as an example of sustainable urban development. With regard to climate adaptation this included the ambition to create a district that is cloudburst resilient. However, the city realised that the actual construction of the district lay in the hands of developers. The city therefore set-out to develop a stakeholder partnership process through which they could bring in the city’s sustainable ambitions, while not actually financing the construction of the development. It allows the city to identify the measures for which additional public funding is needed and thus the optimal mix of public and private funding to realise a sustainable urban development.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Malmö has chosen to realise its sustainability ambitions (including climate change adaptation) by focussing on co-creation with private developers through the organisation of so-called ‘stakeholder partnership processes’. This allows for an effective mix of private and public funding. The approach entails the initiation of dialogues with private developers from the very start of an urban development process. Through the dialogue a sustainable urban development model is co-created for a specific site. In this way the city makes sure that the envisioned sustainability ambitions take shape in the construction of the urban development without having the financial responsibility for its execution. In addition, the city is able to identify through the dialogue whether additional (public) funding needs to be obtained to realise a higher level of environmental standards. An example is the realisation of green roofs in Western Harbour for which Malmö obtained national funding. The dialogue provides the city with a good sense of the environmental ambitions of the developers. When the city feels that a higher level of ambition needs to be achieved, it can decide to bring the option to apply for funding into the dialogue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder partnerships have been a part of large urban development projects in Malmö since the early 1990s. A stakeholder partnership process generally consists of a series of meetings and workshops. The process kicks-off with a common study trip. Afterwards a series of workshops follows for which the city provides the topics depending on the envisioned sustainability goals. Generally the city takes the initiative to start off the partnership process. This involvement decreases over time as the stakeholders take over the initiative for the meetings. The partnership process officially ends once the urban development is completed. However, in some cases the private stakeholders continued their partnerships at their own initiative once the formal arrangement had ended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Western Harbour is an example of an urban development project in Malmö in which stakeholder partnerships were utilized. This former brownfield was redeveloped into a sustainable ‘eco-city’. The development includes both climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Examples of adaptation measures are the application of green roofs, green areas and stormwater management measures. Each developer attached to the development area as either a land owner or buyer was requested to participate in the stakeholder partnership. In addition the city invited other stakeholders relevant to the sustainability goals of the project; the energy company E.on (formerly Sydkraft), the Swedish Energy Agency and Lund University.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way in which the stakeholder participation processes take shape varies per project. Each project consists of multiple phases. One of the first projects in Western Harbour consisting of housing development included the following phases:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Phase 1: This phase included the design of a Quality Program, which consisted of a set of strict sustainability guidelines. The guidelines were developed together with a selection of developers.</li>
<li>Phase 2: This phase revolved around dialogue with the stakeholders. It involved all the private developers attached to the area as a buyer or owner of land. Through the dialogue the stakeholder partnership developed 5 to 6 sustainability goals for the area.</li>
<li>Phase 3: Once a development is built, an evaluation is conducted to check whether the developers have lived up to their promises from the previous two phases.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The Quality Program is a document developed specifically for the Western Harbour case. The document included a common ground for developers, a minimal quality level and requirement standards for architecture, landscape, energy, water, waste management and biodiversity. It outlined a set of guidelines that were developed together with all stakeholders to ensure that high environmental standards were maintained. The program was developed through a set of meetings that are referred to as the “Creative Dialogue” to emphasize its open character. The Quality Program served as a stringent base for the consecutive phases of the project.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The stakeholder partnership process is initiated by the urban planning department. The size of the partnership varies depending on the project. A group of 30 people is considered a small partnership. Such a group might consist of 8-10 developers, who each bring 2 representatives on average. Other participants are usually specialists from the energy company, the municipal waste company or other relevant (municipal) agencies. The composition of experts varies per meeting depending on the topic that is discussed. Private partners may also bring in additional specific experts, such as architects or consultants. So far the partnerships have not included any NGOs or citizens, although this would also be a possibility. The focus of the composition of the partnerships remains on developers as the city intends to impact actors that will eventually shape the site and finance it. Therefore a discussion with them will be the most effective.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several aspects that are essential in the realisation of a successful partnership. One of the most essential factors is trust between the partners. Trust was not evident at the start of the first stakeholder partnership processes for the urban development of Augustenborg. In some cases, developers were found to have difficulties trusting each other since they are usually competitors. New stakeholders are sometimes found to be distrusting of the city. A stakeholder participation process should therefore always start with a site visit to engage everyone at the location. It is important not to start the process with a regular meeting as this tends to cause the participants to quickly get locked-in to their familiar positions. The site visit is followed by a series of seminars and discussions during which stakeholders are divided in sub-groups. These seminars and discussions are initiated by the city and focus on a specific plot or topic. As trust needs to build over time, it makes the stakeholder partnership process less suitable as a solution to short term (policy) problems. However, once trust is gained it is a very powerful tool to realise more sustainable developments at limited public financial investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also external factors beyond the city’s control that can influence the success of a stakeholder partnership process. Environmental awareness among stakeholders is important to the success of a stakeholder partnership. At the start of the process for Augustenborg this awareness was found to be very limited. Other factors that can influence the success of a partnership are developments in national legislation. Until 2016 the stakeholder participation process was complemented by the ‘Environmental Building Code’. This municipal program includes additional technical building requirements, such as energy norms and nature compensation requirements. The Green Space Factor, a tool applied in the Western Harbour case, has been integrated into the program. It was in use for almost 10 years, but a recently passed national legislation has made it impossible to impose more stringent technical legislation at the municipal level. It is not known yet how the implementation of the stakeholder partnership process without the ‘Environmental Building Code’ will affect its impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A stakeholder partnership process can be a useful policy instrument when a city is not financially responsible for the implementation of an urban development, yet would like to exert maximum possible guidance towards targeted sustainability goals for the area. The stakeholder participation process does however require an investment of time from the municipality without a guarantee for success. It also requires an interest of private parties in developing the site. In the case of Malmö, the development of these urban sites by private developers has traditionally been a standard practice. The process therefore works especially well for urban development projects. Other than the investment of time and the use of municipal facilities, the stakeholder participation process does not involve any additional financial investment. It can therefore be a successful tool to implement climate adaptation measures when a city is prepared to invest sufficient time and have patience to see visible results in the long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National and European funding can provide stakeholders in a partnership process with a complementary source of financing to realise environmental measures. It is, however, not a condition for success. In the case of Western Harbour, public funding was obtained to realise the first 3 phases of the development. The 4th phase, while generally being considered the most sustainable part of Western Harbour, did not involve any public funding. This difference can be explained by the generally increased environmental awareness of society by the time the 4th phase was implemented. Through the stakeholder participation process the city gets a good sense of the intentions and means of the developers to realise the city’s environmental vision. The stakeholder participation process therefore allows the city to identify more specifically the type and amount of public funding needed, which consequently increases the chance of success of realising the sustainable development as envisioned.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs for the city to implement a partnership process are limited. They include the time spent by policy officers managing the process and the provision of resources to facilitate meetings and workshops. Private developers are responsible for all the costs relating to the development of the plots. Even the roads, parks and streets on the site, which are developed by the city, are included in the price of the building plots and are therefore indirectly paid by developers. The costs of the development of the building plot itself are completely covered by the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stakeholder partnership process can offer an opportunity to private partners to reduce costs by conducting shared studies. In the case of Western Harbour a sustainability coordinator was employed by the municipality and the developers to make exhaustive energy calculations. The costs involved in this hire were split between the municipality and the developers. These costs would have been much higher in case each developer would have needed to pay a coordinator separately. Projects including stakeholder partnerships may also be eligible for additional funding. In the case of Western Harbour the project received funding as a European R&#38;D project called SURE/RESECO within the EU’s 5<sup>th</sup> framework programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Western Harbour the city applied for funding from both national and European sources to improve energy efficiency, realise green roofs and organise events to raise awareness (i.e. higher level standards). A total of SEK 250.000.000 (approximately € 26.300.000) in national funding (Local Investment Fund) was awarded to the city for the implementation of various environmental projects within Western Harbour. The projects ranged from a sustainability exposition to support developers in the realisation of green roofs. The subsidies were also used to construct more energy efficient buildings. An application for European funding was successfully obtained by the system to finance the energy system in Western Harbour. The system allows Western Harbour to produce energy locally through a wind power plant, solar power generation and geothermal heating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The involvement of the number and type of stakeholders in the funding application varies case by case. The application involving national funding to acquire energy efficient materials for the Western Harbour development was created in cooperation with the developer. In the case of funding for green roofs, the city completely managed the application and the developers applied for the funding from the city. This difference in approach was mainly due to the fact that the decision to apply for funding came later into the development process. The European funding application for the energy system was developed by the city in cooperation with the energy company. The selection of stakeholders to involve in the funding application is usually made by the city based on the input of the stakeholder participation process. This allows the city to make more specific funding proposals. The city always acts as the initiator and lead writer of the funding application.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The participation in a stakeholder partnership process is not completely voluntary. The city can include special conditions regarding a commitment to the partnership and sustainability requirements in the sales contract for the plot. This approach is limited to situations where the city owns the plot that is to be developed. So far the city has only engaged in one partnership with a stakeholder that already owned the land that was to be developed. In this case the dialogue process was found to be more intensive and difficult. Eventually an agreement was reached with support of buyers of building plots from the private landowner.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The first stakeholder partnership was created for Augustenborg in the early 1990s. The Western Harbour development started in 2001 and is still ongoing. The project consists of multiple phases for which different stakeholder partnerships are created.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Regional flood management by combining soft and hard engineering solutions, the Norfolk Broadlands]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Situated in East Anglia, Norfolk Broads (Broadland) is one of the finest areas of wetland in Britain. It includes both open water, the Broads themselves (a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes), and the low-lying marshland surrounding the tidal reaches of the River Yare, the Waveney, the Bure and their tributaries. These rivers reach the sea at Great Yarmouth. The Broadland Flood Alleviation Project (BFAP) is a long-term project to provide a range of flood defence improvements, maintenance and emergency response services along the tidal rivers within the Broadland. The project has been mainly prepared based upon strengthening the embankments to resist breaching with sufficient crest raising to protect settlement and contrast expected climate change and sea level rise effects.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Norfolk is a low lying coastal county. Sea level rise and climate change are among the major concerns for the specific tidally dominated site. The UK Climate Impact Programme (UKCIP) produced several scenarios for the expected impacts of climate change in the Norfolk County. Attending the latest projections for the year 2080, annual average temperature is almost certainly expected to increase in the area, extremely likely between 1 and 5 degrees Celsius; heat waves, winter rainfall and intense rainfall events are likely expected to increase; sea level is expected to rise about 80 to 90 cm; extreme events are also projected to increase, with higher wave and storm surge elevations, greater frequency of winter storms and higher wind speeds, increasing frequency of flooding events (UKCIP scenarios for the Norfolk County, 2008).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For many centuries, the rivers of Broadland played an important role, transporting goods and equipment for trade and industry. Today, Broadland is still busy, although in a different way. Fifty per cent of the land is used for traditional farming. The rivers continue to provide major inland navigation, which, together with the Broads, provide access to 125 miles of waterway. Recreation and tourism have become very important, with thousands of holiday makers visiting each year. In response, the boat hire industry now makes an important contribution to the local economy. The area’s attraction is closely linked to its diversity of landscapes and wetland habitats that give it a quality found nowhere else in the country. The area is internationally important for nature conservation and in 1988 the whole of Broadland was designated as having equivalent status to a National Park. The flood-banks (about 260 km) provide protection to approximately 30,000 ha of land that lies below sea level. All floodbanks are subject to deterioration in condition. This phenomenon results in a reduction in the standard of defence provided, making them more susceptible to the impacts of floods.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing embankments have generally been built using the indigenous marshland peats and soft clays. Historic maintenance of defences had not kept pace with the deterioration rate and in the early 1990s they were susceptible to overtopping and breaching by even modest tidal surges. Moreover, the integrity of embankment foundations was put at risk due to erosion of the river banks, caused mainly by boat wash. In 1996 a flood alleviation strategy for Broadland had been prepared based on strengthening the embankments to resist breaching with sufficient crest raising to protect settlement and address projected climate change effects. The first step of the BFAP project is to strengthen existing flood defences and restore them to a height that existed in 1995, taking into consideration SLR and future settlement of the floodbanks in future steps. The project is not expected to prevent all future flooding as a consequence of overtopping, but will significantly reduce the risk of breach.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many floodbanks have settled since they were built or last improved and are at risk of being overtopped by even fairly small tidal surges. This is expected to be exacerbated by sea level rise and the potential increase in frequency of storm events. Moreover, in some parts of Broadland the existing defences are threatened due to erosion of the river edge (rond) by wind and waves, boat-wash, normal river flows and the action of the tide. Although some lengths have been protected by steel or timber sheet piles, much of this was installed over the last 40 years and now needs replacing or removing. The existing infrastructure and their degree of deterioration have been considered not enough to counteract the increasing pressure caused by the combined effect of climate change and sea level rise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Historically, a large part of the cost of maintaining the flood defences was due to the steel and timber sheet pile erosion protection arrangements installed to prevent the flood banks from being undermined by tidal currents and boat wash. The BFAP sought to replace as much of this hard engineering as possible, with wide reeded ronds (soft solutions), which were effective for that purpose and provided additional benefits appropriate to a national park, as improvements to landscape and ecology. The project follows a regional concept of flood protection which consists of a combination of hard and soft technical solutions implemented in the first step of BFAP:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Floodbank Strengthening</strong></span>. This solution is used where the existing reeded rond is wider than 5m or the erosion protection system or sheet piling is in good condition. This involves the strengthening of the existing floodbank in its present location by placing material on the front and/or back slope of the bank. Raising the crest level may also be necessary and this is usually achieved by placing additional clay at the time of strengthening. The material comes from either widening the existing soke dyke or excavating a new one in the grazing marsh. Typically the strengthened banks will have a minimum 2m crest width and a back slope greater than 1m in 3m. Bank crests are designed to be wide enough to allow maintenance access and further topping up if necessary.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Floodbank Setback</strong></span>. This option consists of the construction of a new clay embankment, 15m to 30m (setback) behind the existing soke dyke. The actual distance of setback depends on local erosion rates, river depth and the quality of land behind the existing floodbank. Once the new bank has established the existing piling or erosion protection will be removed, the existing floodbank levelled and the new rivers edge profiled to promote a stable rond. This is a preferred solution when the bank might become unstable due to failed piling or an eroding reed rond. Its use is subject to suitable ground conditions and the availability of sufficient material for the new soke dyke construction.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Floodbank Rollback</strong></span>. This option is similar to floodbank setback, however, the distance the floodbank is moved inland is considerably less. This approach reduces the amount of land taken but requires additional material to fill the existing soke dyke (for stability reasons). This is a preferred solution when rond/erosion protection is insufficient to allow for just bank strengthening and where ground conditions, topographical features or structures do not permit full setback. It utilises the total lifespan of any existing piling but relies on adequate remaining life.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The project is expected to produce many benefits for the natural environment. The project has been developed in collaboration with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust and other similar institutions to enhance wetland habitats around Hickling Broad National Nature Reserve, including the creation of 55 hectares of freshwater reed-bed. This will contribute to the target required under the Habitats Regulations for losses due to flood risk management schemes on the Suffolk coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By June 2014, BAFP has nearly reached the end of the improvement works phase and interventions have been completed or substantially completed in 33 of the 37 compartments, including: (i) floodbank strengthening along 175 km; (ii) floodbank setback along 50 km; (iii) floodbank re-piling along 7 km; (iv) Other erosion protection including asphalt matting and timber poles combined with reed along 20 km; (v) Piling removal associated with setback areas along 14.5 km. In the period 2006 – 2013 the area has been affected by three major flood events. In these occasions the improved flood defences throughout Broadland did not register serious structural damages. The system is designed to contain flood water till a certain level and to be overtopped in case of major flood without breaching. In the strong event of 2013, large volumes of water spilled over many sections of the bank causing only two minor breaches. This performance has been made possible thanks to the interventions implemented within the project.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Public participation is an integral part of the Broadland Flood Alleviation Project (BFAP) that seeks to involve stakeholders at every opportunity. BFAP has developed a consultation database that contains details of over 1200 stakeholders. These include special-interest groups, businesses, statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as over 500 landowners. An open approach has been adopted to stakeholder consultation, encouraging the participation of individuals and local interest groups in the development of both strategic and site-specific proposals. Separate participatory consultation exercises are undertaken in locations where the provision of first-time flood protection for riverside properties and boatyards are planned (DEFRA - Partnership saving the Broads, 2007; hereafter DEFRA, 2007).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change from vertical piling to more natural river banks has not been welcomed by most boating interests. Piling has provided the facility for casual mooring, added to which there are concerns that piling removal will result in increased rates of sedimentation in the rivers. Action plans for addressing these issues have been addressed, and are working closely with the Broads Authority on the implementation of its Mooring and Sediment Management strategies. Initial public concerns that the project would suffer from the innovative private-public partnership approach due to the need to maximise profit margins have been largely allayed as the partners have shown a willingness to embrace wider benefits. It has, in fact, provided a unique opportunity to integrate flood defence works with other public interest initiatives (DEFRA, 2007).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flood defences have been designed in order to be sustainable and within the strict financial limits of the Project. The public participation process has been helping to make sure of this, both for the Project overall and each individual scheme within it, by clarifying that each part is:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Cost-effective and economically viable;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Technically feasible;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Socially acceptable, e.g. by identifying the possible impacts on, and gains for, local communities;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Environmentally sound, e.g. by identifying environmental gains where possible and by minimising potential negative impacts where they are not.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A major success factor for the project is represented by an effective private-public partnership. In 1992, the British Government launched the Private Finance Initiative, a public-private partnership programme, as a way of providing higher quality and more cost effective public services (Marsh, K, Philpot, M, Payne, D, Russell, D - Broadland; a current model of future delivery? 2010.). Through the Broadland contract the Environment Agency has effectively delegated certain flood risk management functions to a private company, Broadland Environmental Services Ltd. This Private Finance Initiative shell company is used to deliver the contract, comprising stakes of 90% BAM Nuttall Ltd and 10% Halcrow Group Ltd (now CH2M HILL). This Consortium is entrusted with improving and maintaining the Agency’s assets, providing emergency services and acting as a custodian for the environment (Ayling, B, Rowntree, J, and Lancastle, B - Broadland Flood Alleviation Project. Paper presented at Defra Conference, 2002; hereafter Ayling et al., 2002).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A key reason for the success of the Broadland Project has been the equality maintained between the two partner organisations (one public and another one private) particularly given the unequal split in financial risk. The choice of partners and the recognition that each requires the other one’s strengths has been key to building a strong team. The strong interaction between the two company members of the consortium and the UK Environment Agency represented the strength and the main successful factor of this project (Ayling et al., 2002).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite all the positive sides of the implementation of this project, a massive flood protection intervention in a large area such as the one under consideration has also negative impacts. The main limitations (some of them just temporary) identified could be listed as follow:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Temporary disturbance to residential property;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Possible changes in land use from the construction of the flood defence;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Possible impacts on undefended communities by altering the flooding pattern;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Temporary visual effects of works during construction;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Temporary loss of vegetated areas;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Visual impacts of new, large soke dykes;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Temporary disturbance of flora and fauna.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Total value of the contract with the consortium Broadland Environmental Services Ltd. was fixed in 2001 at around 117 million UK pounds. The project is cost limited. This cost ceiling implies that all individual schemes within the project have to be strictly designed to be cost-effective and within the planned programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beside the environmental and social positive effects, the economic cost of the project is expected to be compensated by benefits represented by significant reduction of the losses for the agricultural sector caused by seawater flood events. One of the main characteristics of this project is the consolidation of the flood banks in order to prevent breaches. When a flood bank breaches, the low lying freshwater marshes are submerged by saline water for a long period, as long as it takes to carry out the repairs, possibly several weeks. This is likely to cause long term and thus expensive damage to the agricultural and nature conservation qualities of the land. When overtopping occurs, saline water flooding still occurs but, because the volume of water is much less and repairs to the flood bank are not usually necessary floodwater can be pumped back into the river within 2-3 days, which is usually quick enough to prevent any significant long term damage to the agricultural land. The difference between the damage costs due to breaching and overtopping is one of the benefits taken into account in designing the project. On the cost side of the calculation, there was only sufficient suitable material available locally to increase the bank heights back to the 1995 levels. To increase the bank heights further and totally prevent overtopping, large volumes of construction materials would need to be transported long distances, the cost of which would have far outweighed the benefits.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1996, the UK Environment Agency began a process to consider the potential use of the Private Finance Initiative approach for procurement of Flood Risk Management services. As a result, the Broadland Flood Alleviation Project (BFAP) was one of only two selected and designated “significant projects with pathfinder status” by the Treasury (Hayman, S, Marsh, K, Lancastle, B – Partnership saving the Broads, 2007; hereafter Hayman et al., 2007). A full description of the nature of the Contract and the procurement process were given in a paper to the 2002 Flood and Coastal Management Conference (Ayling et al, 2002). The key feature is that, within the Broadland area, the Contractor is responsible for providing a specified standard of Flood Risk Management service, including maintenance, improvement works and emergency response. The purpose of this partnership between the public and private sectors is to further the drive for cost-effective delivery of public services through operational efficiencies and innovation, and this is embodied in the bespoke contract form. The Agreement is for a 20 year period, with a requirement to deliver the improvement works between the 2nd and 12th years. Payments reflect the rate at which works are carried out, with no large up-front capital commitment by the Contractor (Hayman et al., 2007).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Room for the River Waal – protecting the city of Nijmegen]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The river Waal bends sharply and narrows near Nijmegen, the Netherlands. That the river may flood at high water as a result became clearly evident in 1993 and 1995. Adequate measures are necessary in order to protect the inhabitants of the city against this type of flooding and its impacts. In the case of Nijmegen, these measures involve moving the Waal dike at Lent and constructing an ancillary channel in the flood plains. This latter measure will create an island in the Waal and a unique urban river park in the heart of Nijmegen with room for living, recreational activities, culture, water and nature.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[integrated approach, Nijmegen, urban development, dike relocation, room for the river]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The River Waal is the largest river in The Netherlands. It is a lowland river starting at the Pannerdens Canal, where the River Rhine splits into the Lower Rhine and the Waal. Its width is 350-400m on average. The first part, until the city of Nijmegen, is characterised by broad meanders and a broad winter bed up to 2 km wide. The second part is narrower and only slightly meandering and the associated floodplains are also narrower. The city of Nijmegen has a waterfront with landing places for ships. On the south shoreline of the river there is no room for the river to expand. On the other side of the river, there is a dike that protects the village of Lent against flooding from the river. Here, the river is at its narrowest. During periods of high river discharges, the town runs the risk of being flooded. Projections show that river discharges are expected to increase in winter time because of increased precipitation in the catchment area. The town of Nijmegen therefore faces increased threats of flooding, particularly as it is located at a bottleneck in the river.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the project was to protect both Nijmegen and Lent from flooding by creating more room for the river.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">In the challenging project "Room for the Waal" solutions to climate change and urban development go hand in hand. By widening the floodplain, more room is created for the water and as a consequence the water levels in the river are reduced. To protect the area at the bend of the river Waal against flooding, a secondary meander will be dug, creating an island in the river Waal. The construction of a secondary meander will also create a unique urban river park in the heart of Nijmegen with space for living, recreation, culture, water and nature. The digging of this secondary meander, together with the relocation of the dike, construction of three bridges and the construction of a new quay is all part of the "Room for the River’ programme". The digging of the secondary meander has started in 2013.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;"><em>The "Room for the River" programme</em><br />The residents in the Dutch river region were confronted with particularly anxious times in 1993 and 1995. The water levels in this region were extremely high and the dikes just managed to hold. A quarter of a million people had to be evacuated. Extremely high river discharges are projected to occur more frequently in the future and for this reason it was decided to ensure that the rivers could discharge the projected greater volumes of water without flooding. The Government approved the Room for the River Plan in 2007. The Plan has three objectives:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">by 2015 the branches of the Rhine will cope with a discharge capacity of 16,000 cubic metres of water per second without flooding;</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">the measures implemented to increase safety will also improve the overall environmental quality of the river region; and</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">the extra room the rivers will need in the coming decades to cope with higher discharges due to the projected climate changes, will remain permanently available.</div>
</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To develop the plans, stakeholders and the local community were engaged through newsletters, information meetings and interactive workshops. In the interactive workshops, plans were presented and the participants could provide their inputs. The plans were adapted on the basis of the inputs from these workshops. Through graphics and models, the effects of measures were visualised. Moreover, the whole planning procedure was subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment procedures, including participation. Through the broad involvement of stakeholders and serious responses to their inputs, the stakeholders’ doubts and opposition were largely addressed. Overall there is currently broad support for the project.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">An important success factor was that the overall programme ‘Room for the River’ is coordinated and largely funded by the national government. It was a coordinated effort that not only focused on one location, but spread the overall problem over a range of measures at different locations. Each measure contributes a part of the solution. In addition, the programme was developed as a coordinated programme involving in total 19 partners, including national government, provinces, municipalities and water boards. The specific projects, moreover, were conducted with broad involvement of stakeholders and the local community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">An important limiting factor was the limitation of the budgets. This was partly overcome through securing additional funding from the provinces, water boards and municipalities. In addition to available funding, a limiting factor was the need for expropriation of land and compensation schemes for periodic flooding of lands included as part of the measures adopted.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">Total costs of the project are 351 million euro from the national budget.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">From the viewpoint of safety, measures would have been necessary. Other, cheaper measures, like deepening the river bed, would have sufficed for one or two decades. The chosen measure of dike-relocation would probably have become necessary in the long run. From a strict economic point of view, the costs do not outweigh the benefits. However, the benefits of nature and recreation may be underestimated in the economic analysis, while the dike-relocation, an expensive measure, may have been unavoidable over time. Moreover, the measures introduced contribute to the overall goal of the "Room for the River" programme.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">High river discharge situations in 1993 and 1995, causing the evacuation of 250.000 people in 1995, have led to a change in policy. Where the old policy was based on discharging surplus water to the sea as quickly as possible, the new policy became to first retain water, then store the water and finally discharge the excess water. The new water policy was later linked to nature development and implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Digging started in 2013. Relocation of the dyke, construction of the ancillary channel and island raising are to be realised by 2016. The area will be further developed in the years after to allow for recreation, housing and other urban functions.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Saltmarsh recreation by managed realignment, Hesketh Out Marsh - UK]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hesketh Out Marsh is the biggest managed realignment project in the UK, and is one of the country’s most important estuary habitats for birdlife. The original saltmarsh was isolated from the estuary in 1980 by the creation of an outer wall, and was used for growing crops. With the sea level rising, it was necessary to create stronger sea defences. By a process known as “managed realignment”, seawater has been let back in to flood the land, re-creating saltmarsh and providing space for nature. At the same time, the new saltmarsh acts as a buffer, soaking up some of the energy of the sea before it reaches the stronger, new sea defences.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hesketh Out marsh lies on the southern shore of the River Ribble estuary, near Preston, and is one of the country’s most important estuary habitats for birdlife. The original saltmarsh was isolated from the estuary in 1980 by the creation of an outer wall, and was used for growing crops. With the climate changing and the sea level rising, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Environment Agency recognised the need to plan for the future and create stronger sea defences against flooding.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal of the marsh realignment was to protect existing built assets and infrastructure on adjacent sites against flooding and help the estuary adapt to the threat of sea level rise, avoiding adverse impacts on estuary processes. Other objectives included:</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;">to create intertidal habitat for nature conservation;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to create intertidal habitat that has unhindered tidal exchange, requires minimal management and has the capacity to respond to dynamic estuarine change;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to avoid adverse effects on water quality and especially on bathing beaches as a result of faecal coliforms deposited in new intertidal areas by grazing animals;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to maintain or enhance the existing landscape character, including features of historic, archaeological and environmental importance.</li>
</ol>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">As sea levels rise and we experience the effects of climate change, we are starting to look at new ways of managing the coast, moving away from the solid flood-defence structures that have previously protected our coast and estuaries. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Environment Agency are exploring a more natural way of dealing with coastal flooding, through what is called "managed realignment" – using land as a place to store floodwater. In the past, this land might have been drained for farming. But allowing floodwater back on to the land returns it to salt marsh or mudflats. These can then absorb the impacts of higher sea levels and increased storm surges resulting from climate change.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought half of the land at Hesketh Out Marsh in 2006, to turn into a nature reserve. Since then, they have been working with the Environment Agency and other organisations to create salt marshes, creeks and lagoons. After first upgrading the original embankment inland, the Environment Agency then removed sections of an earlier (1980s) privately built embankment. This allowed high tides back on to the nature reserve to re-create 168 hectares of salt marsh habitat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">By working in partnership with the Environment Agency and with funding from Lancaster City Council, and the Lancashire Rural Recovery Action Plan, the Hesketh Out Marsh project has greatly improved the local sea defences and created 160 hectares of new saltmarsh, creeks and lagoons. Creating flood defences in this way uses more land but the initial cost is recouped over time in reduced maintenance costs of the associated sea defences.  As a result of newly created habitats, wildlife in the area has more chance of thriving.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The RSPB worked in partnership with the Environment Agency and with funding from Lancaster City Council (LocalC), and the Lancashire Rural Recovery Action Plan. Several other stakeholder organisations from the UK were involved in the project. The project also created facilities and a nature trail for visitors that help to disseminate the project goals and results; furthermore, RSPB frequently organizes activities such as walks in the Reserve.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors included:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>commitment to partnership working particularly between the Environment Agency, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Lancaster City Council;</li>
<li>the engagement of the several partners during the various phases of the project design and implementation, that ensured the necessary financial resources and the political will to deliver the Project;</li>
<li>adoption of an ecosystem-based and adaptive management approach.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Limiting factors included:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">concerns over the impacts on the land drainage upstream of the site were raised by some local landowners and contributed significantly to the design of the scheme;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">the potential for the Project  to increase the risk of bird-strike for the neighbouring aerodrome determined that the lagoon size was limited to 1ha and islands, (that might attract nesting gulls), were not included in the design.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The total costs of the Project are not available but the EA estimates that about £2m saving was made from the ability to use local soil for the bank improvement work. The high cost of the land meant that the Project only became economically feasible when the opportunity arose for the site to provide compensatory habitat to offset damage to the Morecambe Bay SPA.  Lancaster City Council were looking for a suitable compensation site to offset lost intertidal habitat that would result from a project to improve the defences on part of Morecambe’s sea frontage.  LocalC were able to help fund the purchase of the site as compensation for the habitat loss in Morecambe Bay SPA occasioned by the sea defence works at Morecambe.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The EA were able to contribute a significant amount towards the cost of the land in exchange for the use of the soil derived from excavating the creeks and lagoons on the site enabling them to greatly increase the size and strength of the sea defence. The availability of the material on site made the Project feasible because it meant that a hugely expensive and environmentally damaging operation to import soil to the site by road was not necessary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Further funding from Biffaward and Natural England has enabled facilities for visitors and for the cows and sheep that graze the marshes to be provided as well as funding research into the many changes that are taking place at this exciting new reserve as it returns to the wild.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The main positive outcomes were the increased protection of the area from flooding and the creation of new saltmarsh habitat for water birds, invertebrates and fish to replace losses elsewhere. The Project also created a significant new recreational asset for the Ribble Coast &#38; Wetlands Regional Park attracting 10,000 visitors p.a. as well as a dynamic educational resource for students of coastal change and adaptation.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Tamera water retention landscape to restore the water cycle and reduce vulnerability to droughts]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tamera, a farm of 154 ha, is located in the most arid region of Portugal (Alentejo). This area has shown significant trends of increasing erosion and desertification and climate change will most probably exacerbate these issues. Tamera has managed to counteract such trends of increasing erosion and desertification through the creation of a “Water Retention Landscape” (WRL) comprised of a system of lakes and of other retention systems, and also including other structures such as terraces, swales and rotational grazing ponds. This approach to water management has created a regenerative basis for autonomous water supply, the regeneration of topsoil, forest, pasture and food production, and greater diversity of wild species.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[ecological restoration, erosion, Biodiversity conservation, desertification, water retention landscapes]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Progressive desertification is currently one of the biggest problems in southern EU countries. In the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the south, decades of incorrect water and land use management have triggered a dramatic desertification process. The Alentejo region of Portugal, is considered an arid region: the erosion process has progressed so rapidly and extensively in this area that the humus topsoil has disappeared. This humus soil layer, which was shaded and rooted by plants, is fundamental to soak up the rainwater and thus to give the water time to seep into the deeper ground layers and fill up the underground aquifers. Moreover, it acts as a buffer contributing to prevent floods and to increased water quality in streams and aquifers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change is expected to further increase desertification in this area. The Mediterranean drylands have been identified as one of the most prominent regions affected by climate change projections (temperature rise) larger than any other European region. Increase in heat waves, together with a decrease in precipitation, envision a future of increased risk of desertification and biodiversity loss for most of southern Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The projected increases in frequency and severity of drought events can strongly affect soil erosion, loss of top soil and nutrients flow and availability. These issues are directly connected with the capability of ecosystems to deliver key services, such as water purification, and with agriculture productivity and human habitability of such regions.</p>

    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The creation of a water retention landscape had the goal of counteract the increasing trends of erosion, desertification and droughts observed in the area. This in turn allows Tamera to become self-sufficient in terms of water and food and to reduce its vulnerability to climate change and water-related extreme events such as droughts, water scarcity and floods. Another goal is to use Tamera example to demonstrate a model that can be implemented in other Mediterranean areas prone to desertification.</p>

    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Water Retention Landscapes (WRL) are systems for the restoration of the full water cycle by retaining the water in the areas where it falls as rain. A WRL is a landscape with no rainwater run-off, where only fresh springwater leaves the land. The rain which falls on such an area is taken up by the vegetation or the water-bodies and recharges the groundwater. The retention areas act in place of the fragile humus layer and, through their high water absorbing capacity, they also help to prevent fatal landslides and floods, which nowadays are caused more and more often by intense rainfall. There are many measures that can be used in various combinations to create WRLs (several of them have been used in Tamera as well):</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The construction of water retention spaces in the form of decentralized lakes and ponds;</li>
<li>Reforestation and the planting of mixed-culture ground cover vegetation;</li>
<li>Holistic grazing management;</li>
<li>Keyline design: a planning technique for maximizing beneficial use of water resources that considers topography and landscape features such as ridges, valleys and natural water courses, seeking optimum water storage sites and potential interconnecting channels;</li>
<li>Terracing;</li>
<li>Swales: low tracts of land, usually moist or marshy. Artificial swales are often designed to manage water runoff, filter pollutants, and increase rainwater infiltration;</li>
<li>Infiltration of road and roof runoff water by different means.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Four principles are particularly important for the shaping of such water retention spaces:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The vertical sealing layer of the dam (of a water retention space) consists of fine materials (ideally clay), usually using the material excavated from the deep zones. It is connected to a watertight layer of subsoil that sometimes lies a few metres below the surface. The sealing layer is compacted and built-up layer by layer with fine, earth-moist material. Then it is piled up from both sides with mixed earth-material, covered with humus or topsoil, and can then be landscaped and planted on. Through this natural construction method the water retention spaces fit in with the landscape and do not become incongruous with their surroundings.</li>
<li>The longer side of the retention space is, if possible, laid out in the same direction as that of the prevailing wind. The wind then blows over a long surface, thereby forming waves which oxygenate the water: oxygen is an important element for the purification of water. Wind and waves carry particles of debris to the shores where they are trapped by aquatic plants and eventually absorbed by them.</li>
<li>Banks are never artificially straightened or reinforced, but created in meandering forms with both steep and gently sloping parts so that the water can roll and swirl. At least one part of the shore is planted with aquatic and waterside plants.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Deep and shallow zones are created. In this way different temperature zones emerge providing healthy thermodynamics in the water. Shaded shore areas support this process. Thus a diversity of habitats allow for a high diversity of aquatic organisms to be established.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tamera, the creation of lakes has proven to be a faster and more effective method to reduce erosion than reforestation which is a much slower process. It was used as a first step to allow for reforestation to be done in the most eroded areas. A series of interconnected retention areas (from swale sized to pond-sized to lake-sized) were created using the local earth and stone material. The construction of the first water retention space, “Lake 1”, located in the centre of the Tamera site, was realised in 2007. “Lake 1”, with a total capacity of 6.400 square meters, was totally filled during the second winter after its’ creation. Already within the first year a new seepage spring arose which since then has flowed continuously throughout the year from Tamera to the nearby farms. In 2011, another retention area, with about three times the capacity of “Lake 1”, was built.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From 2006 to 2015, 29 lakes and retention spaces were created and the area of water bodies was increased from 0,62 ha in 2006 to about 8,32 ha. Tamera is now prepared to fully absorb even strong continuous rainfall. This large retention area is located at the highest point of the valley. The water pressure is therefore high enough to irrigate all of the land, without additional energy needs for pumping. This highest-situated retention space can then provide enough water to maintain stable all year round the water level of the further down retention spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The water retention landscape creates space for riverside forest plants and fruit trees; in Tamera, chestnut, alder, ash and elder tree were planted. Forest corridors offer a protected path for wild animals to reach the lakes and ponds. Also, further away from the water bodies, olive trees, cork oaks and a huge variety of native trees were planted to increase diversity and productivity.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was opened and discussed with the population of the region. Cooperation from neighbours has been important in several of the building stages.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main obstacles for these type of projects is the financial investment needed to build the Water Retention Landscapes, since this investment is about half a million euros. Regarding this obstacle, the ecovillage of Tamera used its communication and publicity capacity to raise private funding and donors to sponsor its vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other main obstacle has been represented by the legal and regulatory framework. For ex-ample, in Portugal it is forbidden to cut cork trees, even if this is done to build a lake and plant more cork trees in another place. Furthermore any private or public initiative can take months or years to receive permissions for land use changes or never receive these permissions. Tamera chose to illegally implement the innovative adaptation measure and ask for permissions after-wards. They are presently in the process of resolving all the legal obstacles, namely by making a special rural spatial plan, an instrument of spatial planning that allows for the creation of spe-cial spatial management for specific territories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two success factors were considered particularly relevant for the adoption of the Water Retention Landscapes approach and the implementation of related actions:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">the knowledge and information of the people responsible for designing the WRL, in particular to create landscapes adapted to the local climate;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">the capacity to convince and mobilize the ecovillage of Tamera to take on this multi-functional investment.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The criteria used to assess the overall social welfare impact of the WRL in Tamera is the Net Present Value (NPV), which accounts for the sum of all discounted benefits for the analysis period minus the sum of all discounted costs in a single monetary common unit – the euro (€). The time period 2015-2050 and a discount rate of 3% were used in the analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The calculation of the total costs included: construction costs, licensing, fees and taxes. Other costs involved such as wellbeing reduction and pollution during the construction phases could not be accounted for. Identified benefits of the implementation of the WRL included:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Increased carbon storage;</li>
<li>Improved water quality;</li>
<li>Benefits from increased number of visitors/water-related events;</li>
<li>Reduced irrigation needs because the soil is saturated with water and the aquifers are filled;</li>
<li>Social benefits (e.g. recreation value of the lakes; increase of the quality of life in the ecovillage);</li>
<li>Agricultural benefits, including increased productivity, diversification of products and increased income;</li>
<li>Reduced vulnerability to climate change effects, such as those related to increased drought frequency and intensity and reduced annual precipitation, as lakes provide good quality water to crops and livestock and reduce losses due to long droughts;</li>
<li>Increased biodiversity, since the WRL creates a diverse habitat where wildlife species can live. It also acts in controlling pests and enhancing pollination;</li>
<li>Stabilization of the groundwater table. Since 2011 the community of Tamera supplies all of its drinking water needs from wells that are fed by the Water Retention Landscape. Soon after “Lake 1” was created, a new spring appeared, feeding a small stream which flows from Tamera to the neighbouring land all year round. Thus, the lakes also support neighbours and fireman in times of drought or fire.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The economic assessment was done only for some of these benefits as some others could not be quantified. The quantified benefits were:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Transitional woodlands increased from 9,34 ha to 19,50 ha mainly in areas previously occupied by natural grasslands. This lead to an overall increase in carbon storage of 9.4 %/year between 2006 and 2014.</li>
<li>Estimated net income for 2014-2050 in tourism and water-related events such as the Water Symposium and the Permaculture Seminars is 810.000 €.</li>
<li>The role of water in the landscape as a crucial element for social and environmental well-being and a thriving society, especially in semi-arid regions, was internalized by taking into account that the market valuation of land and the price elasticity of rural property is tightly connected with water availability, storage and water quality. Benefits were estimated between 150.000 € to 400.000 €.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The NPV regarding the variables and proxy’s considered resulted being negative (- 261.551 €), meaning that the high costs involved in the construction of the lakes are not overtaken by the discounted benefits, which would be a strong argument against the development of this type of projects. However, it must be acknowledged that slight changes in the discounting of benefits would have a major impact in the NPV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, and even more important, it must be taken into consideration the fact that many of the benefits could not be quantified. One important variable which was excluded from the cost-benefits analysis due to lack of reliable data was the increased agriculture production which is expected to be very high. Also, the price of water is expected to increase over the next years and the value of resilient ecosystems will be much valued in such semi-arid regions. Because such projections are uncertain these have not been quantified.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Several directives and laws limited the implementation of WRLs. The EU Directive No. 2000/60/CE (also transposed to national legislation) considers that all uses of water are obliged not only to map, identify and name their water sources and uses but also to pay a tax on the use of water resources. This means that Tamera had an extra cost for legalizing it’s lakes. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is also a big condition for adopting climate adaptation measures as it limits several management practices (e.g. the types of trees and crops that can be cut and that can be planted).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Vrijburcht: a privately funded climate–proof collective garden in Amsterdam]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Vrijburcht is a multipurpose living-and-working complex in Amsterdam. It offers many shared social amenities for both the residents and the people from the neighbourhood. The heart of the complex is the courtyard garden with trees, a vegetable garden, lawns, flowers, benches and a greenhouse. The garden provides various solutions to the expected impact of climate change; it offers residents a cool environment during warmer summers; rain water is stored in underground tanks for irrigation in dry periods; the unsealed area permits maximum rainwater permeability. The complex was realized and financed through of a ‘collective private commissioning’. Future residents jointly develop the project, which gives them maximum influence on the design but also includes carrying the risks related to the pre-financing and construction phase. The climate-proof courtyard garden was an integral part of the design of the complex and its features based on the wishes of the future residents.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[surface permeability, rainwater tank, Collective garden, landscaping, private commissioning]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and more intense extreme rainfall events in the Netherlands. Studies suggest that 1 degree temperature increase would add 14% to the rainfall volume during extreme precipitation events. In Amsterdam, already now, intense rain showers often lead to flooding due to the limited permeability of the city’s surface areas. Getting rid of the water seems a first and obvious reaction. However, under a future climate, dry periods may occur more often during the summer months, requiring irrigation of urban vegetation in public and private spaces. Water should therefore be preserved within the urban environment. Also, temperatures will rise and the average temperature is expected to rise 1-1.3 degrees Celsius in 2050.  This will be accompanied by more hot summer days and more frequent heat waves during which the built environment may become unpleasantly warm.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary objective of the residents-to be  for the Vrijburcht building block was to offer an attractive and sustainable building for people to live, work and meet by creating a mix of affordable housing, ateliers/offices and public space. The complex was primarily financed by the residents-to-be. All houses are reached via the courtyard that functions as a central and informal area for residents to meet. At the same time it should reduce the risk of pluvial flooding, store rainwater for irrigation and decrease heat stress by providing a good micro-climate to the users of the building.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The complex comprises 52 apartments, two guest rooms, a care home for six youths with slight mental impairments, a shared hobby space, a cycle shed and a parking garage, a day-care centre, a café with a water-side terrace, a theatre, a floating platform for swimming, and a landing pier for a sailing club. The courtyard garden provides solutions to prevent or reduce flooding from extreme rainfall, drought during dry periods and heat stress during hot summer days:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Rain water from the roof tops is collected in two tanks that are buried in the garden and can in total contain 6000 l of water. This water is used for irrigation of the garden and the plants on the surrounding terraces/balconies and covers the total irrigation needs in most of the years.</li>
<li>The car parking garage is constructed under the building and the garden is paved minimally to create maximum permeability for rain water in the garden.</li>
<li>Relief is created so that water flows from higher parts to a marsh-like environment. This prevents flooding of the garden and enhances vegetation diversity by creating dryer and wetter environments across the courtyard garden.</li>
<li>Drainpipes are detached from the facades at ground-floor level and together form a pergola construction for creeping plants. This minimizes the impact of eventual leakages on the facade. Creeping plants are also used at the exterior of the building were they cover wind screens to form green facades.</li>
<li>The many trees in the garden provide shade and thus contribute to an agreeable microclimate on hot summer days.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">To be able to realise the building complex and courtyard garden, a collective private commissioning (CPC) initiative was started allowing the future residents to organise themselves and realise their wishes (see also ‘Stakeholder participation’).</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is a collective private commissioning (CPC) initiative. This means that future residents jointly developed the project, including carrying the risks involved in the pre-financing. Future residents organized themselves in a foundation (Vrijburcht Foundation). This organisational set-up has the benefit that it gives much freedom to the future residents to realize their wish, but also asks for strong commitment to the process. All costs were carried by the Vrijburcht Foundation on behalf of the (future) residents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was no subsidy involved. Instead Vrijburcht Foundation arranged with Rabobank the option of a personal loan at favourable interest rate and arranged procedures for a special mortgage construction of Amsterdam for people with an average regular income (the so-called ‘Amsterdamse Midden Hypotheek’). Also the (social) housing corporation ‘De Key’ provided financial warranty and know-how.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vrijburcht was initiated in 2000 by a group of people around the architect, all living in the centre of Amsterdam. They saw the possibility to create their own new housing in a CPC project. It was their vision that the building should include working spaces and a theatre function. This small group of people started to involve more people, and presented their plan to the municipality. The municipality of Amsterdam reserved specific areas of the newly constructed island ‘Steigereiland’ for the CPC project. In 2002 a parcel was definitively allocated to Vrijburcht. In the course of 2002 it became clear that there were not enough participants yet. At this stage the (social) housing corporation ‘De Key’ got involved and in 2003 De Key signed an agreement with Vrijburcht Foundation, which was legally established the same year. The agreement concerned back-up and support in the realization of the programme, and the financing of 21 homes, subsidised rental of housing for assisted living for six young people with a light impairment and their attendants (De Roef), and the purchase and lease of the day-care and café building. ‘De Key’ has been granted a passive general board membership in the Vrijburcht Foundation. The courtyard garden commission becomes active in 2004 and presents its plans in a workshop in June 2004, around the time of the completion of the preliminary design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the courtyard garden was made by landscape architects who were also involved in Vrijburcht Foundation as residents-to-be. Their involvement in an early stage of the process made it possible to come to a real integration of garden and building (e.g. parking garage fully under the building and not under the garden, pergola construction of rainwater pipes) and a serious budget for the garden. Via presentations, excursions, an opinion poll and several workshops with other future residents a common idea about program, atmosphere and design style was formed. A separate ‘garden commission’, responsible for the maintenance of the garden, still exists.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors of the initiative are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The building construction/development process was a collective process with the common wish for a building that was sustainable in both social and climate context. The concept of the green and sustainable courtyard was broadly supported by all stakeholders.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Early involvement of landscape architects in the collective process was a key element to integrate the green space with the building and to reserve enough money from the total project budget to realize it.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Vrijburcht Foundation consisted of people that invested a lot of time and effort in the process, which is a prerequisite in a collective and private commissioning. The landscape architects brought in their professional experience into the process management as members of the Vrijburcht Foundation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The (social) housing foundation ‘De Key’ provided financial warranty by financing the houses that were not yet sold, and by letting these out, and by letting out other spaces (e.g. day-care centre and housing for slightly disabled people). ‘De Key’ also provided experience in overseeing the construction phase. This enabled the start of the building at the stage in which there were not yet enough private participants. ‘De Key’ took part in the Vrijburcht Foundation but gave the private participants space to develop their own concept.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Low-tech measures were taken which made the garden affordable and sustainable (e.g. use of common creeping plants instead of technical solutions for green facades).</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs of the garden itself were € 55.000, excluding the costs of the rainwater storage facility (€ 17.500) and a greenhouse (€ 30.000). The total costs of the building complex were € 16 million. The costs of the garden were carried by all residents/users as part of the total costs through the Vrijburcht Foundation (see also ‘Stakeholder participation’). The garden was a collective wish of the stakeholders and was financed by them by making compromises in the overall design of the complex: the overall budget was fixed but the garden could be financed by economizing on other aspects of the building design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On annual basis the costs for maintenance of the garden amount to € 3.000, including the contribution of a gardener next to the voluntary work of the residents. Also costs of the maintenance are carried by the inhabitants and ‘De Key’ as part of the regular service fees of the building, managed through the homeowner association. A garden commission takes care of the overall aspects of the maintenance of the collective garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Benefits are difficult to express in monetary terms. The garden contributes to the well-being of the residents and a good micro-climate. Inhabitants for example do not feel the need for air conditioning in their houses. Water for irrigation of the many plants on terraces besides the courtyard garden comes from the rainwater storage facility which meets the water needs in most years. Flooding of the garden during intense showers is prevented. The garden is also a recreational place where residents meet, thus underlining the collective aspect of the complex, provides fruit/vegetables and serves as a natural playground for children.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the project was done through private collective commissioning. Private persons jointly acquired a piece of land and united themselves in a Foundation that acts as a commissioner for the whole project. This means that residents have influence on the project through the hoc created Vrijburcht Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the project was realized, all owners of the apartments and other spaces in the building  have been united in the Homeowner Association (Vereniging van Eigenaars), which is a legal entity that takes care of the maintenance of the building and other shared interests, among which the garden. The association has an executive committee, a general assembly, a chair and a financial committee and is a common structure in all cases in the Netherlands when more owners are involved within a building.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Creation of man-made snowdrifts for improving the breeding success of the Saimaa ringed seal]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Saimaa ringed seal (<em>Phoca hispida saimensis</em>) is an endemic sub-species, a relict of last ice age that lives only in Finland in the fragmented Saimaa freshwater lake complex. Nowadays the population has only about 360 individuals, which poses a threat to its survival. This land-locked population is threatened by varied anthropogenic factors, such as incidental by-catch mortality, habitat loss and climate change. The breeding success of the Saimaa seal is dependent on sufficient ice and snow cover, because the seal digs its dens in snowdrifts where it gives birth and nurses a pup. Therefore, global warming poses an increasingly serious long term threat to this arctic seal. A Finnish national conservation strategy and action plan for the Saimaa ringed seal was adopted in 2011 in order to improve the conservation status of the sub-species. The LIFE Saimaa Seal project, running from 2013 to 2018, promotes the safeguarding of the Saimaa seal and the efforts to reach a favourable conservation status of the sub-species. The project implements the Saimaa seal protection action plan, drawn up under the leadership of the Ministry of the Environment and in broad-based cooperation with key stakeholders. One of the most important measures related to climate change was the creation of man-made snowdrifts in winters 2014-2016 to improve the seals breeding habitat in poor snow conditions.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Boreal]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change poses a long-term threat to the Saimaa seal population, because the successful breeding of the sub-species depends on ice and snow cover. Seals give birth typically to a single pup in a subnivean lair that is situated at snowdrift formed on the shoreline of the lake. The lair provides shelter against predators and harsh climate, and mother-pup pair uses it over the nursing period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In winters with good snow conditions about 8% of the pups are found dead in lair sites. However, a mild winter and a lack of snow can cause high perinatal mortality (as in 2006 and 2007, ca. 30%). The snow cover of Lake Saimaa has been exceptionally thin during some of the recent years. For example, during the winter of 2014 there was total lack of wind drifted snow mounds needed for the seal lairs. This situation can be further exacerbated by global warming and related changes in climatic conditions. Moreover, due to the land-locked lake habitat the Saimaa seals are no able to move to more favourable areas in response to climate change.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Saimaa seal project aims to reduce the main threats to the Saimaa ringed seal, which were identified in the Saimaa seal conservation strategy and action plan. In particular, it seeks to reduce risks related to climate change, fishing, and human induced disturbance. The results of the project will be used in the updating of the conservation strategy and related regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main goals of the project is to facilitate adaptation to climate change by piling up man-made snow drifts to improve the Saimaa seal´s breeding success during mild winters. Other goals include reducing by-catch mortality by developing seal-friendly fishing methods, reducing human-induced disturbances, involving local people in conservation actions and increase their awareness, and updating knowledge on essential ecological issues and on potential threats to the seals, as the basis for effective conservation and monitoring.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The man-made snowdrift method was developed at the University of Eastern Finland. Its full scale implementation as a new conservation method has been done during the LIFE Saimaa Seal project, to improve the seal’s pup survival in mild winters when the snow cover is not sufficient for lairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the winters with poor snow conditions in 2014-2016, altogether 519 man-made snowdrifts were piled up at the breeding habitat of the seal. The drifts were annually piled in January and early February. The shape and size of the man-made drifts mimic the natural wind drifted snow mounds. Saimaa ringed seal lairs are located on ice in snowdrifts on shoreline. Man-made snowdrifts were piled using natural snow collected nearby the drift site using snow shovels and pushers and the drifts were located in the vicinity of the potential lair sites. Minimum snow cover on ice for making a snowdrift is around 5 centimetres. The exact dimensions of the snowdrift depend on location and amount of snow available. However, snowdrifts should be large enough for large birth lairs, i.e., approximately 1 m high, 3-6 m wide and 8-15 m long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over 200 people were involved in making the snowdrifts, and most of them were volunteers. Based on lair census conducted annually (in 2014-2016) during March-April the man-made snowdrift method appears to be an effective conservation action; briefed local voluntary workers are well suited to its implementation. During these three winters the majority (&#62;75%) of man-made snowdrifts were used by seals as lair sites, and in exceptionally mild winter of 2014, over 90% of the observed pups were born in those drifts. Due to this conservation action, the perinatal mortality remained significantly lower compared to earlier winters with poor snow conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The LIFE Saimaa seal project is also implementing other measures that do not address directly the effects of climate change but reduce seals’ mortality, and therefore increase their resilience also to climate change. Seal-safe fyke nets (a type of fish trap used by professional fishermen, for perch and pike-perch) have been developed in collaboration with local professional fishermen. Also nearly 300 gill nets of recreational fishermen have been replaced by seal-safe fish traps (a different fishing gear type, smaller than the fyke net mostly used by professional fishermen). The goal is that altogether 500 gill nets will be replaced by the seal-safe fish traps during the project (thus by 2018). Moreover, nearly 1,500 stoppers, which make the traditional fish traps seal-safe (by preventing the maximum width of the opening being wider than 15 cm and thus blocking the seals way into the trap), have been given out for free. In addition to these concrete actions, recreational fisherman may sign a voluntary commitment to use seal-safe fishing methods also outside the fishing restriction period. Until now over 400 fishermen have signed the commitment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Management plans for Natura 2000 areas vital for the Saimaa ringed seal have been prepared or are under preparation and 34 ha land (islands) and 670 ha of water have been acquired for nature conservation. Finally, a number of initiatives for awareness and educational purposes are also being undertaken.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Metsähallitus, Parks &#38; Wildlife Finland is responsible for most of the conservation and monitoring measures of the Saimaa seal. The research conducted by the University of Eastern Finland has played a crucial role in developing the man-made snowdrift method and participating in annual lair censuses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of the volunteers is also extremely important both for making the snowdrifts and for monitoring and evaluating the population dynamics. During the years, experienced local volunteers have participated in the annual lair censuses of the Saimaa ringed seal. These volunteers know the demanding field work conditions on the ice and the traditional breeding sites of the ringed seals. The LIFE Saimaa seal project aimed at building a larger scale network of volunteers based on this initial group of key volunteers to cover the whole distribution area of the seal in order to be prepared for the possible challenges of warming winter climate. In addition to the conservationists, the volunteers included recreational fishermen, politicians (local and national), policymakers, local inhabitants, summer residents and members of several NGOs. Thus, it is a good example of how a concrete conservation act can induce openness and involvement of local people to conservation and bring people together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the winters of 2014-2016 an enormous effort was needed to pile up the man-made snowdrifts because of the poor snow conditions on Lake Saimaa. Altogether over 200 volunteers made this work possible. During around two weeks’ annual operation in 2014 and 2016, when the implementation of the man-made snowdrifts covered most parts of the seal’s distribution area, the volunteers worked totalling 169 (i.e. eight months) and 247 (almost 12 months) full-time equivalent days, respectively. In addition to volunteers and Metsähallitus also some cooperation partners, like University of Eastern Finland, WWF Finland and local Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, participated to the realisation of the man-made snowdrifts in a notable effort. The total number of man-made snowdrifts piled up was 240 in 2014 and 211 in 2016. During winter 2015 altogether 68 man-made snowdrifts were piled up in the central part of the lake where the snow conditions were weakest, and volunteers played a crucial role then as well.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The man-made snowdrifts have shown to be an effective method to decrease the pup mortality in winters with poor snow conditions. The perinatal mortality fluctuated from 8% to 16% during these three winters (2014-2016) when man-made snowdrifts were piled as a conservation act, whereas the perinatal mortality in earlier mild winters, before the method was developed, has been near 30% (e.g. 2006 and 2007). The seals have accepted around 75% of man-made snowdrifts as a lair site and during last three winters altogether 59% of observed pups were born in man-made snowdrifts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project has received the Biodiversity Award 2013-2014 awarded by the National Committee of Finland for IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The preliminary results have also raised interest outside Finland as a new, simple and innovative solution to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on a highly endangered population has been tested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the man-made snowdrift method is effective only as long as there is some snow available and the lake has contiguous ice cover. Already now, the amount of snow and/or ice has been a limiting factor at some areas also for the man-made snowdrifts. Therefore, development and testing of long lasting artificial lair structures has also started in this project to insure cover for the new born Saimaa seal pups in the future.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total LIFE Saimaa Seal project budget is 5,261,612 €. From the total budget 75% is funded by European Union’s LIFE+ Nature and Biodiversity Fund. The action “Improving breeding conditions of the Saimaa ringed seal with man-made snowdrifts” is one of the 63 actions in the project, and the costs for this specific action is about 4% of the total project budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most (59%) of the pups born during 2014-2016 were born in lairs made in man-made snowdrifts and the perinatal mortality was significantly lower compared to earlier winters with poor snow conditions when the method was not in use, which highlights the usefulness and success of the technique (for further details refer to the “Success and limiting factors” section).</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Saimaa ringed seal has an IUCN status of endangered (EN) sub-species and in the Habitat Directive the status is a species needing strict protection (Council Directive 92/43/EEC, Annex IV). According to this latter, the deterioration and destruction of a habitat, breeding site, and resting place important for the survival of a species (or sub-species) under strict protection is prohibited. Therefore, the LIFE project has obtained the permits from for the local Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment for piling up the man-made snowdrifts at the seal’s lair sites. In addition, the following legal elements are relevant for the Saimaa seal conservation project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conservation policy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Saimaa ringed seal was protected in 1955 by a statutory decree based on the Hunting Act. In 1993 legal protection was transferred to the Nature Conservation Act, and the responsibility for management was given to the Ministry of Environment and in practice to the Parks &#38; Wildlife Finland that is a public agency that forms part of the state-run enterprise Metsähallitus. A conservation strategy and action plan for the Saimaa ringed seal was adopted in 2011 and is currently being updated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conservation areas and programmes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Saimaa lake district the establishment of the Linnansaari National Park in 1956 was a significant factor for protection of Saimaa seal (9,600 hectares, winter stock of 65-86 seals). Kolovesi National Park was established in 1990 and the protection of the Saimaa ringed seal was the main contributing factor for conservation of the area (2,300 ha, winter stock app. 9-12 seals). There are also some privately owned conservation areas established for the protection of Saimaa seal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Finnish National Shoreline Conservation Programme was adopted in 1990. It also gives the means to protect the breeding habitats of the Saimaa ringed seal. In the lake Saimaa the programme covers 92,000 ha (mostly water areas). Most of the distribution area of the seal is included in the Natura 2000 Network; Natura 2000 areas cover a total of 157,426 ha (33,022 ha land, 124,404 ha water). Respectively, the Shoreline Conservation Programme and the Natura 2000 network cover approximately 70% and 95% of the shorelines where the seals’ lair sites are located. To implement the conservation programme and conservation goals of Natura 2000 network, nature conservation areas have been established and areas acquired for the state for conservational purposes. Implementation of the Natura 2000 network is carried out also by means of land use plans in line with the Land Use and Building Act, fishing restrictions according the Fishing Act and establishment of restriction areas under the legislation regulating motor vehicle use in terrain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fishing restrictions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Lake Saimaa, fishing has been restricted since the 1980s to protect the Saimaa ringed seal. Fishing closures and restrictions are main conservation measures for the ringed seal population and the restriction areas have increased from 1.5% to ca. 60% of the lake’s surface area. At present, the fishing restriction decree (259/2016) has one spatial (covering ca. 60% of the lake), and two temporal (spring-time and year round) fishing restrictions. During spring (from 15 April to 30 June) which is the most critical period for pup survival, the use of gill nets is banned. Whereas, the use of most lethal fishing gear types for seals (e.g. fish traps with an opening wider than 15 cm, strong-mesh gill nets, hooks baited with fish and multifilament nets) are banned year-round. Despite of the spatial enlargement in 2016, the areal coverage of the decree is still smaller than the breeding or distribution area of the Saimaa ringed seal especially in the northern and southern parts of the lake. In addition to the decree, also voluntary based fishing restriction contracts are implemented in water areas near the decree area (covering 81 km<sup>2</sup> at September in 2016). Financial compensation is paid to water owners (the owners of the fishing right) for signing the voluntary fishing restriction contract in the or nearby decree area.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Man-made snowdrifts were built annually (in 2014-2016) during a short period (couple of weeks per winter and before reproductive season). The drifts will be piled up also in the future, if they are needed due to poor snow conditions.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Coastal protection by managed realignment, Titchwell Marsh]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Titchwell Marsh lies towards the western end of the North Norfolk coast. It forms a key part of the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area (SPA) and SAC (Special Area of Conservation). The freshwater and brackish habitats at Titchwell are protected by seawalls. However, these walls would almost certainly fail within the next few years, due to coastal erosion. The project implemented a “managed realignment” scheme at Titchwell Marsh alongside the strengthening of the seawalls protecting the most important freshwater habitats in response to climate change and in particular to the expected increase in sea level rise. The managed realignment will protect the vital freshwater habitats within Titchwell Marsh nature reserve from destruction by the sea.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">England’s eastern coast is rich in birdlife but under considerable pressure from climate-induced sea-level rise, isostatic change and coastal erosion. This leads to “coastal squeeze” where intertidal habitats are prevented from migrating landwards due to the presence of sea walls and increased threat to internationally important coastal freshwater habitats. Government policy on shoreline management now tends to favour management solutions that respect natural processes and adapt to coastal change. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) reserve at Titchwell Marsh in north Norfolk is such a case where there is an imminent risk of habitat loss.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal of Titchwell Marsh Coastal Change Project was to provide flood defences for designated freshwater habitats in the short, medium and long term, whilst minimising impacts on the designated habitats outside the flood defences. Project objectives focused on:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Protecting freshwater habitats from coastal erosion destruction; and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mitigating/compensating for the inevitable loss of important brackish marsh.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project implemented a “managed realignment” scheme at Titchwell Marsh in response to climate change and related sea level rise. The project included the strengthening of the existing western wall and the construction of a new wall (the Parrinder wall). These two walls aim to protect the freshwater habitats for at least the next 50 years. In addition, the project created a breach in the sea wall to connect the brackish marsh to the tidal saltmarsh to the east. The breach was located to tie into existing saltmarsh creeks. This would allow the sea to enter into the brackish marsh, which would turn back to tidal saltmarsh: the brackish marsh will frequently flood with the tide, allowing it to develop into saltmarsh and mudflats. These new habitats are not only attractive to birds, but they act as sea defence in their own right and will play a significant role in protecting the new Parrinder wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The brackish marsh supported an important number of breeding avocet, a designated feature of the North Norfolk Coast SPA. To offset the loss of avocet nesting habitat following the managed realignment, additional nesting islands were created in the freshwater marsh at Titchwell (mitigation) and additional new avocet nesting habitat was created at the RSPB’s nature reserves at Frampton Marsh and Freiston Shore (compensation). The project was considered to act as a good example of using mitigation and compensation in the context of Natura 2000. The RSPB would thus promote the project as a case study for raising awareness about managing the impacts of climate change on coastlines and their wildlife.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of 2011, the work on the sea walls (including strengthening of the western wall, construction of the new Parrinder Bank and the breaching of brackish marsh) was completed. Freshwater habitats are now protected by 5.8m AOD (Above Ordnance Datum) sea defences with a flood defence standard of 1 in 30 years. This should be sufficient to protect the site for the next 50 years until less erosive coastal environment exist at Titchwell. The coastline at Titchwell Marsh currently sits on a sediment drift divide where longshore drift removes sediment in a westerly direction and local currents driven by the presence of the Scolt Head barrier beach system to the east of Titchwell remove sediment in an easterly direction. The barrier beach system at Scolt Head has been expanding in westerly direction for many years and it is predicted that as Scolt Head continues to expand west, the erosive point will pass Titchwell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area from which the materials for the new Parrinder sea wall were excavated was land-formed; water control structures were installed to create an additional 2.4ha of reedbed habitat. The creation of a new reedbed in this area was an important side benefit of the project. By the end of the project, reed had started to naturally colonise the area and it is anticipated that within ten years the area will be a fully functioning reedbed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The maceration of encroaching reed using a previously untested technique was also extremely successful. The area previously covered by reed has been colonised by curled dock which has provided additional sources of seed food for wintering waterfowl. It is anticipated that repeated treatment will be required every five to ten years, depending on the rate of reed re-growth. The installation of the new fresh-marsh sluice with twice the capacity of the old one has enabled water levels to be managed more dynamically than was possible before. The move from a drop-board to a tilting weir sluice also allows to manage water levels more precisely so that the ideal water levels for passage wading birds can be achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An additional side-benefit of the works is that it was possible to extend the visitor trails around the new area of reedbed.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The key stakeholders in the project were Natural England (the UK government’s statutory nature conservation advisor), the Environment Agency (the public body responsible for coastal flood defence), Eastern Sea Fisheries (now Eastern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Agency, the agency responsible for the management of inshore fisheries), the local community living in the villages closest to the reserve and existing visitors to Titchwell Marsh. The support of these stakeholders was critical in securing the necessary consents for the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Individual meetings were held with Natural England, the Environment Agency and Eastern Sea Fisheries responded to a scoping report. Telephone conversations were held with two key local fishermen and three consultation days were held for the local community with over 150 people attending. Additional interpretation was provided for visitors to the reserve. An annual newsletter was produced for the duration of the project to keep local residents informed on progress.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factors decisive for a successful outcome</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>A clear understanding of the coastal processes affecting Titchwell Marsh was critical in determining the most appropriate solution to the problem.</li>
<li>Working with, not against, coastal processes was vital in gaining the support of Natural England and the Environment Agency.</li>
<li>Investment in local consultation and communication was essential in securing planning consent. No objections were received from the local community.</li>
<li>Appointing experienced contractors who understood the challenges of working in an environmentally sensitive site.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factors that hindered the process and needed to be overcome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the breeding and wintering bird interest at Titchwell, construction work could only take place within a three month window (August, September &#38; October) where disturbance could be minimised. This meant that the project took three years to deliver and the working window coincided with the busiest period for visitors thus impacting on visitor numbers and business performance.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Half of the cost of the project was covered by the European Commission, through its LIFE+ financial instrument. Additional funding was provided by Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd (WREN), SITA Trust and the Crown Estate. The project total budget was 2,009,660.00 € with a EU contribution of 1,004,830.00 €.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An important co-benefit of the project was the creation of a new reedbed habitat which provided additional habitat for species such as the waterfowl as well as an extended route of the visitor trails. In addition, the new fresh-marsh sluice was able to manage water levels more dynamically (please see detailed description of co-benefits under “2.6 Solutions”).</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As the proposed works were within the Wash and North Norfolk Coast SPA and SAC sites and were likely to have a significant effect (specifically on some of the designated features of the North Norfolk Coast SPA) an Appropriate Assessment of this proposal was required. Information was provided in the Environmental Statement accompanying the planning application to inform the Appropriate Assessment, including details of mitigation and compensation measures considered necessary in respect of relevant affected designated features at the site. Information was included to demonstrate that other relevant requirements of the Habitats Regulations were met, including the consideration of less damaging alternative solutions and imperative reasons of overriding public interest (IROPI) linked to the site designations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main impact of the proposed scheme on the SAC interest features was the conversion of the brackish marsh to an intertidal area characterised by mudflats and saltmarsh. This would be a positive impact leading to an increase (11.09 ha) in the area of intertidal habitat within the designated sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The proposed scheme would have been a temporary negative impact upon shrubby sea‐blite Suaeda vera, an interest feature of the SAC. Shrubby sea‐blite was found along the sea walls at the Titchwell Reserve and so would have been impacted by works to strengthen and raise the walls. A planting scheme for shrubby sea‐blite was prepared that would result in a net increase in the overall distribution of the species at Titchwell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The major direct adverse effects on the designated SPA / Ramsar site would have been on the wintering high‐tide wader roost and breeding avocet population (ca 52 pairs). Both these SPA qualifying features were located on islands in the brackish marsh which would be lost following realignment. The RSPB was committed to ensuring that the necessary mitigation and compensation measures were in place and fully functional before damage to the North Norfolk Coast SPA occurred at Titchwell. The predicted adverse effects on the high tides wader roost could be wholly mitigated through the creation of new islands in the freshwater marsh at Titchwell. This would also benefit the breeding avocet population although a precautionary approach was taken and a compensatory habitat for breeding avocet at our Frampton Marsh and Freiston Shore Nature Reserves on the Lincolnshire side of The Wash was created.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Titchwell, the area of islands in freshwater marsh was increased from 5,450 square meters to 10,175 square meters. The new islands provided suitable habitat for the high tide wader roost and nesting habitat for a minimum of 18 pairs of breeding avocets. As there were no readily available, suitable sites within the North Norfolk Coast SPA to create replacement habitat to mitigate against the impacts on the remaining 34 pairs of avocet, habitat creation in The Wash (the nearest available location) was identified as the next best area to compensate for the residual adverse effect on breeding avocet.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Climate-adapted management of  the Körös-Maros National Park]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Körös-Maros National Park, SE-Hungary, was created in 1997 for the protection of birds. Located in the region consisting of the meandering branches of river Körös and on the Dévaványai, it has a variety of habitats including steppes, remnants of wooded grasslands and marshlands as well as meadows and groves of extraordinary value. The impacts of climate change to these habitats can be great and varied, but also can exasperate the impacts caused by other pressures. To address these impacts, a specific climate-change adaptation management plan (which includes management strategies and measures, restrictions, barriers, indicators, and methods for stakeholder engagement) has been created.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;">There has already been a change in average annual temperature and precipitation in Hungary and projected changes are expected to pose new threats to the Körös-Maros National Park. Projections indicate an increase in average anual temperature of 2°C for 2021-2050 for the area. These changes will have diverse impacts on the Park’s habitats and biodiversity, the extent and timing of which will depend on individual sensitivities to climatic changes, as descfribed below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><em>Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes (1530)</em><br />These habitats are very dependent on the duration of wetting and temperatures, both of which affect salt accumulation and other soil characteristics. Periods of low or no rainfall result in drying of the steppes and marshes (note that  there is already a regular trend of drying), while excess summer rainfall may increase leaching of the soil, leading to reducing salt characteristics and thereby  degradation of the salt steppes and marshes. Sodic habitats are among the most endangered as they provide special, complex soil conditions that can support both steppic meadow species (due to humus content) and meadow species (due to groundwater effects) and sodic species (due to sodium-salt accumulation at around 1 m depth). If any of these processes/conditions change (becomes stronger or weaker), the habitat composition will change. Variable circumstances and climate extremes, including those as a result of projected climate change, can be beneficial for habitats such as dense and tall <em>Puccinellia</em> swards  or Annual salt pioneer swards of steppes and lakes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><em>Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion or Hydrocharition - type vegetation (3150)</em><br />As a projected impact of climate change, decreasing rainfall harms hydrophyte vegetation with its levels simplifying as a result of horizontal and vertical degradation. Species number may fall as species with tight ecological tolerance disappear. Species requiring high naturalness state of habitat (<em>Myriophyllum verticillatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, C. submersum, Utricularia australis, Salvinia natans</em>) will be at risk of disappearing. The increase of less sensitive species is expected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> </span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Maintenance of water regime, solving the problem of water supply and excess water because of neglected waterworks, avoiding too high water level during spring (not to threaten nesting birds and private-owned areas) or summer (enabling mowing and cutback of Typha stands) by directing water into canals towards fishponds.</li>
<li>Prevention against invasive species.

<li>Preservation and restoration of river habitats and their connectivity with adjoining terrestrial habitats (lateral connectivity).</li>
<li>Monitoring water quality in the canals that are the sources of water supply in dry years.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Results of the implementation of these measures are being monitored. However, monitoring has just started and there is no documentation (at the end of 2013) of results available, yet.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Key stakeholders were nature conservation administrations on local, regional and national level, water management administration on regional level; regional tourism associations and research institutions. The partnership consisted of National Park administration along with national nature conservation and water management authorities since they are in the best position to involve relevant stakeholders. Media communication, such as press releases and newspaper articles were produced to bring the issues of the project to the attention of the public and increase awareness. Direct approaches were taken with stakeholders and target groups via fair participation and exhibitions in park information centres. A project workshop brought together local and regional stakeholders to discuss the project topics and results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As climate literacy is just in its initial phase in the Hungarian rural areas, it was presumed that stakeholders were not overly concerned about climate change topics. It became apparent in the stakeholder engagement exercises for the Climate Adapted Management Plan that stakeholders connect several problems with weather extremes and long-term changes. However, practically no actions are undertaken in favour of mitigation or adaptation. The stakeholder dialogue has broadened the information basis about possible impacts and projected developments of climate change, thus, the relatively low awareness was heightened and the engagement process hopefully had a beneficial side-effect of strengthening their consciousness and willingness to decrease their carbon footprint as well as to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The active participation of stakeholders in these processes, including integrating their interests and needs in the development of climate adapted management plans, increased the likelihood for the proposed adaptation and mitigation measures and practices.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main success factors were the profound knowledge of national park officers and park rangers, and their direct connection to the land owners and users (farmers).</p>

    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Coast is about 50,000 EUR for the whole basic study and planning process; source: 85% EU ERDF, 15% national.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Benefits are hard to quantify: although the results of the implementation of these measures are being monitored. Monitoring has just started and there is no documentation of results yet available. Benefits include the maintenance of the water regime, addressing the problem of water supply and excess water; increasing the resilience of agricultural systems; maintenance or recovery of several protected habitats and endangered species; and strengthening local stakeholders’ consciousness and willingness to decrease carbon footprint as well as to adapt to climate change.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Hydropower expansion and improved management in response to increased glacier melt in Iceland]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Iceland has 100% renewable electricity and heat system due to its abundant hydro- and geothermal resources. Despite the clear dominance of geothermal resources for house heating, hydropower plays an important role in Iceland’s energy mix, enabling Iceland’s electricity generation to be 100% renewable with 73% coming from hydro; 27% from geothermal and less than 0.01% from wind. The biggest hydroelectric power stations in Iceland are fed by glacial rivers. Over the last decades, increased flows and changes in the seasonal distribution of river flows have been observed. Further increases in flows are expected from melting glaciers due to global warming. Hydropower stands to gain from increased water flow due to climate change induced glacier melt, but reservoir management will have to be adjusted to account for this increased flow. Landsvirkjun, the national power company of Iceland, has included adaptation to climate change both in terms of management, but also in designing, updating and expanding its assets accordingly.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Rising global temperatures caused by climate change are expected to cause increased glacier melt in Iceland, thereby increasing water flow at hydropower plants. Almost all Icelandic glaciers have been losing mass since the early 1990s; this trend is expected to continue with the warming climate. It has been projected that almost no Icelandic glaciers will be left in 2200. The flow in glacial rivers will increase concurrently with glacial melting. The runoff is expected to peak in the next 50 years, after which the runoff from glacial melt is expected to decline up to the level of zero in 2200.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the year 2015 increase in inflow scenarios using 2015 climate is about 10% higher than had been predicted through historical climate records. The inflow scenarios represent historical inflows since the 1950s up to today that have been projected to (a) certain year(s) into the future using both estimated historical trends in temperature and precipitation and projected future trends due to climate change. To date the existing power system has been mostly able to utilize this increase in flow without investment. The inflow volume is projected to increase by an additional 15% by 2050, compared to 2015. The existing power system can only utilise 30% of that increase. Without modifications to existing hydropower plants, the rest of the increased flow is expected to be spilled over the spillways. To fully utilise the increased flow rates, both the installed turbine capacity and reservoir storage at existing hydropower plants will need to be increased.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The warming of the atmosphere under climate change causes accelerated glacier melting, which results in increased water flow at hydropower stations. The first objective of Landsvirkjun (the National Power Company) is to improve projections of water flow under climate change. Better projections facilitate adaptation measures that minimize unnecessary water spills through the spillways. These measures includes modification of reservoir-management plans, installation of additional infrastructure, and/or the re-design of existing infrastructure to manage increased runoff. A co-benefit is increased flood protection, as the reservoirs can function as extra buffer capacity in the case of extreme flooding.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In collaborative research with other Nordic governments and research agencies as part of the group Norden, Landsvirkjun uses hydrological modelling to project future water flow, taking climate change impacts into consideration. Projections on future river flow were improved through use of observed temperature and precipitation data, and glacier area-volume-elevation curves were adjusted according to trends from climate model simulations. This information was then fed into a hydrological model to produce corrected flows that account for climate change. Landsvirkjun incorporated corrected flows into its reservoir management strategies. The organisation updates the flow series, and following that its reservoir management, every five years to reflect changing climate conditions. For new design and the refurbishing of older plants, Landsvirkjun uses as a design specification that considers future flows within 15 years and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The corrected flow series of Landsvirkjun use data from IPPC as well as specific results for Iceland, such as the expected seasonal distribution of changes in temperature and precipitation. The flow series is further calibrated annually based on monitoring results. These findings are used for adjusting reservoir management and for assessing possible redesigns and upgrades of current power stations as well as proposals for future projects. In essence, the management and design of existing and planned assets is adjusted to take advantage of increased glacier flows, based on improved data on current and future flows. These measures result in an increased production of renewable energy in Iceland, because of reduced losses of water resources through spillways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Búrfell Hydropower Plant provides an example where improved water flow data made an expansion economically feasible: the power plant capacity was increased from 70MW to 100MW. Landsvirkjun decided to build a new hydropower plant, which extends the original power plant and reduces its load. The new Búrfell extension was built underground for economical and sustainability reasons; it is operational since June 2018. The Búðarháls Hydropower Plant is a new project commissioned in 2014. The capacity of that plant was increased from the originally planned 80 MW to 95 MW in response to climate change. The Hvammur Hydropower Project is a future project, where capacity has also been increased based on the corrected flows, from 82 MW to 95 MW. The Hvammur project has been approved by the Icelandic Parliament under the “Master Plan for Nature Protection and Energy Utilization” (see the section on legal aspects), but a decision to start construction has not been taken.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The company collaborated with Norden to identify and analyse the impacts of climate change on renewable energy systems. Norden is a regional collaborative initiative, involving governments and research agencies from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Åland. The programme is funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this collaborative research, observed temperature and precipitation data, as well as glacier area-volume-elevation curves, were adjusted according to climate model trends. Historical data on glacier melt and projected increase in runoff and the resulting volume of water were obtained. This exchange of knowledge and research among Scandinavian countries ensured a well-developed evidence base that is reviewed by a research consortium and as such disseminated in the wider community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Public consultation has been included in the design of expansion of current hydropower sites through the environmental impact assessment procedure, as is guaranteed by Law. Acceptance has also been sought by applying the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAP) for the Hvammur Hydropower Project and for the operation of the Blanda Hydropower Plant. The latter received the Blue Planet Prize from IHA in 2017.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Success factors:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Collaboration with other power companies, universities and institutions facilitated and boosted the credibility of adaptation efforts; this was mainly done through the Norden consortium.</li>
<li>The Executive Board of Landsvirkjun is involved in the adaptation process</li>
<li>A step-by-step approach to climate change adaptation: every five years, past trends and projections of precipitation and temperature are reviewed, while a yearly calibration of models is performed based on monitoring results, in order to adjust current management and investment taken by Landvirkjun.</li>
<li>Given the uncertainty in climate projections, Landsvirkjun maintains alternate plans that can be implemented should the selected scenario prove to be inaccurate. Such alternate plans include having curtailing agreements with major consumers, where a proportion of contracted annual energy sales can be curtailed, in addition to having plans ready for the construction of new renewable hydropower, geothermal and wind power projects.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Limiting factor:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The increased water flow is expected to be temporary. The ice-melting flows are projected to reach a plateau by 2030 and to stay constant afterwards up to 2080. By 2080, the volume of the glaciers will have decreased so much that the flows will start reducing. This long-term phenomenon has little effects on current decisions, which have a decision horizon of 50 years. Once flows have returned back to the levels of 1990’s, i.e. before the Icelandic glaciers started losing mass, the existing hydropower plants may have somewhat higher capacity than needed.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Costs:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The cost of investing in research projects as part of a Scandinavian collaborative initiative (Norden) was moderate, about 1 million Euros.</li>
<li>The cost of modifying the reservoir management plans is moderate and is reflected as internal cost, such as adding 2-3 staff members.</li>
<li>The cost of modifying the design of planned assets (in most cases, the capacity of hydropower projects is increased) is high, in the order of tens of millions of Euros.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Main benefits:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The improved hydrological modelling has yielded valuable information for decision-making regarding future investment on hydropower plants.</li>
<li>The increased generating capacity of 10% to date responding to increased water flows due to current and project climate change is increasing annual revenues.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Increased reservoir capacity installations can ensure buffer capacity against extreme flooding, thereby leading to increased flood protection. The most extreme flood events in Iceland are glacial outburst floods due to volcanic eruptions. Glacier outburst floods are more common in Iceland than elsewhere in the world because of the interaction of volcanoes with glaciers.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “<a href="http://www.ramma.is/english">Master Plan for Nature Protection and Energy Utilization</a>” is a tool to reconcile the competing interests of nature conservation and energy production on a national scale and at the earliest planning stages. However, the climate adaptation aspect is not considered in these planning stages, and it is also not included as part of the environmental impact assessment procedure. Important aspect to consider is in Iceland hydropower is delivering 73% of its share of renewable energy and as such is an important contribution to Iceland’s energy mix.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It took four years (2006 to 2010) for the Landsvirkjun company to use corrected flow series in the decision-making on reservoir management and investment decisions on future assets. The installation of extra capacity in the Búrfell power station took just over two years from the start of construction (2016).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[An integrated plan incorporating flood protection: the Sigma Plan (Scheldt Estuary, Belgium)]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sigma Plan is an integrated flood protection plan that was first established in 1977 in reaction to a major storm surge flood in 1976. The Sigma Plan offers protection against storm surges as well as floods caused by excessive rainfall. Its objectives also include nature protection and navigation. The plan protects approximately 20,000 hectares of land in Belgium bordering the Scheldt River and its tributaries such as the Rupel, the Nete and the Durme Rivers. In order to achieve adequate protection, the plan combines ‘grey’ infrastructure measures, mainly strengthened dyke protection, and ‘green’ measures in the form of a network of controlled flood areas. In early 2014, approximately 500 hectares of controlled flood areas were operational and in 2015 the total area should increase to 1200 hectares; ongoing work will continue to expand this area in coming years. </p>

    <field_sectors><![CDATA[Coastal areas]]></field_sectors>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The original Sigma Plan conceived in 1977 was designed to protect the coastlines of the Scheldt and its tributaries against storm surge floods. However as the execution of the plan progressed, new requirements arose including the need for further adaptation to climate change. When the Sigma Plan was updated in 2005, it was understood that the existing plan was insufficient to provide adequate protection both under current conditions as well as for the likely conditions predicted by climate change models. The 2005 update referred to a projected sea level rise of 9 to 88 cm by 2100, taking into account varying estimates of seawater expansion, melting of the icecaps and glaciers and climate sensitivity; this was based on the IPPC Third Asessment Report, released in 2001.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The updated Sigma Plan used as a baseline for its protection measures a sea level rise of up to 25 cm by 2050 and 60 cm by 2100. The current level of flood protection offered by the works already completed, plus the soon to be completed <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/../../../viewmeasure?ace_measure_id=5101"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 9.0pt; mso-ascii-font-family: Verdana; mso-hansi-font-family: Verdana;">Kruibeke controlled inundation area</span></a> </span>should protect up to an event that occurs only once every 350 years without sea level rise. With a sea level rise of 25 cm by 2050, the current level of protection is decreased to an event occurring once in 70 years. By 2100 the level of protection would be reduced even further to once in 25 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The current plan is now focused on protection until 2050. Belgium has chosen to apply differentiated flood protection levels along the Scheldt based on the likelihood of deaths and the potential extent of economic damage; the minimum level of protection is a flood event occurring once in 1000 years. A number of possible additional measures are prepared for after 2050 in case they are needed to address higher sea-level rise; these will be undertaken depending on the projections then available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be noted that the average tidal amplitude of the river has increased significantly during the past century: in Antwerp the average high tide level has increased by 56 cm. These changes are largely due to human interventions affecting the flow of water through the Scheldt. Changes include the diverting of water to feed into canals, the removal of river meanders by straightening the river and increasing the depth of shipping channels. These changes exacerbate impacts from climate change.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objectives of the actualised Sigma Plan are: to protect the land bordering the Scheldt River and its tributaries such as the Rupel, the Nete and the Durme Rivers from storm surges and river flooding; and to help Belgium meet its EU obligations for nature protection.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">While the Sigma Plan’s main purpose is flood control, it is based on an integrative perspective on river management which acknowledges various river functions and their importance for society. These include: shipping, nature development, landscape values, cleansing functions, fish nurseries and more. The Sigma Plan was originally conceived in 1977 with flood control as its main purpose; since then perspectives on water management have evolved. An updated Sigma Plan was adopted in 2005. It was based on three main pillars; flood protection, access to Scheldt Ports and a natural functioning of the physical and ecological system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original Sigma Plan called for dykes stretching a total length of 512 kilometres to be raised and strengthened, the establishment of 13 controlled flood areas covering a total of 1133 hectares, as well as the construction of a storm surge barrier. Plans for the storm surge barrier were later suspended after analysis showed that the benefits did not outweigh the costs. The realisation that the storm surge barrier was prohibitively expensive, together with an increased demand for a healthier river ecosystem, led to a greater application of a concept called ‘room for the river’. The revision also took into account projected climate change impacts. The revised plan gives a greater role to controlled flood areas (CFAs) and depoldered areas that counter storm surges by temporarily storing excess water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Controlled flooding areas have low dykes, called overflow dykes, along the river, and higher dykes on the inland side to maintain flood protection: the overflow dykes allow water to flood during storm surges; after high water levels have receded, drainage outlets allow water to exit. The CFAs help attenuate the impacts of flooding events by increasing the river catchment area, thus reducing upstream water levels. The volume of many CFAs is increased as their ground levels are below the average water level due to historic compacting of the soil and loss of natural sedimentation processes. These low ground levels however mean that overflow dykes and artificial water regulation are needed. The predominant use for land within CFAs has been as nature areas that contribute to achieving conservation objectives and improving water quality. Under EU nature legislation – in particular, requirements to compensate for the loss of natural areas taken by the expansion of the Port of Antwerp – the total area set aside as flooding areas was increased for the purpose of nature development: by 2030, a total of 2458 hectares are to be created. Another 656 ha have been indicated as possible future flood zones to be constructed after 2030 if necessary to guarantee flood safety beyond 2050.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some CFAs also include controlled tidal areas, where a regular, reduced tide is produced through an adjustable weir system in the overflow dyke. During high tide, water from the Scheldt flows into the area through a weir and during low tide it flows out through a low weir. The controlled tidal areas allow for the creation of tidal habitats while maintaining the CFA’s functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other Sigma Plan projects consists of depoldering areas, where dyke protection is moved inland exposing a former polder (land reclaimed from the water) once again to tidal influences. Depoldered areas provide room for river water during high water levels, and thus they, like the CFAs, attenuate storm surge levels. They also provide room for estuarine nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The updated Sigma Plan also calls for raising an additional 24 kilometres of dykes and increasing the land set aside solely for flood protection to 1523 hectares (390 ha more than in the original plan). The dykes and weirs on the Scheldt Estuary were raised as follows:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">to level +11.00 m TAW (Tweede Algemene Waterpassing = Second general water elevation level measurement) from the Dutch border to Oosterweel;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to level +8.35 m TAW from Oosterweel to Temse;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to level +8.00 m TAW from Temse to Schoonaarde;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">to level +7.50 m TAW from Schoonaarde to Gentbrugge.</li>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Flanders Region has followed a strategy of open communication in order to implement the Sigma Plan in a way that maximizes public acceptance and support. The communication strategy is coordinated by Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV (W&#38;Z) (Waterways and Sea Channels), a department of the regional government, with consultation at ministerial level and under the oversight of a steering group (<em>stuurgroep Sigmaplan</em>). The Steering Group includes representatives of the Department of Waterways and Sea Channels, the Agency for Nature and Forests, the Department for Land Use Planning, the Department for Housing Policy and Heritage Buildings, Department of Environment, Nature and Energy, Department for Agriculture and Fisheries, Flemish Land Agency, the Executive Secretariat of the Flemish-Dutch Scheldt Commission and the OS2010 working group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Communication is carried out using various tools including brochures, newsletters and educative materials for children as well as meetings to disseminate information and discuss key issues with stakeholders. Specific types of stakeholders have been actively involved in the planning, including agricultural organisations, environmental NGOs, hunters, fishers and the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The communication strategy focuses on three outcomes from the Sigma Plan. The first and primary pillar is the increase in flood safety; the other two pillars are recreation and nature protection.

    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2005, the total costs for realising the updated Sigma Plan were estimated at 882 million Euros: 830 million for construction works and 52 million Euros for accompanying measures. In 2010, an update of the estimates resulted in a cost estimate of 994 million Euros for the works and 62 million Euros for the accompanying measures, due to mainly to overall price increases. The cost for remaining work on the Sigma Plan from 2010 to 2030 was estimated at 928 million Euros (reflecting work undertaken since 2005).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The update of the Sigma Plan included a detailed cost benefit (CBA) analysis to assist in determining the optimal plan. In total, 180 potential areas were considered for use as controlled flood areas, with a total surface area of 15000 ha. The CBA took into account the average annual flood risk during the 100 year project life, allowing for a sea level rise of 60 cm and taking into account climate change. The economic risk with only the works of the original (1997) Sigma Plan without the storm surge barrier completed was estimated to be 942 million Euros. From the cost benefit analysis, it was found that the optimal scenario included the raising of dykes and the use of CFAs. The safety benefits of the optimal scenario were estimated to be 736 million Euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A cost benefit analysis of the ecosystem benefits was also undertaken. This analysis used various available market prices for goods such as for timber production, reed production, carbon dioxide capture, fish production (shrimp), and the prevention of riverbed erosion leading to a reduction in dredging activities and studies to price goods and services with no available market values. Goods and services with no available price information were studied using contingent valuation methods and hedonistic pricing, for example by seeing how housing prices near the project areas could change. The hedonistic price change was estimated using data from other studies while for the contingent valuation study a total of 1704 questionnaires were collected. The conclusion of the extensive CBA to determine ecosystem benefits found that the benefits range between 143 and 984 million Euros, with the highest level of benefits realised by the maximisation of the use of controlled tidal areas. The non-use value that people attributed by people was the largest benefit measured but also the most contentious. From the cost benefit analysis it was concluded that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From an environmental perspective, several benefits and losses can be identified. Benefits include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Restoration of estuarine processes with accompanying water quality gains;</li>
<li>The development of more robust nature areas of high quality that are protected at European level;</li>
<li>Desirable changes to the sedimentation regime, with increased sedimentation in the inundation zones leading to a lower turbidity in the river;</li>
<li>A reduction in tidal energy.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Losses include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The loss of former cultural landscapes (mainly agricultural landscapes);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Impacts on agriculture and other land use functions in flood zones (monetary compensation and in some cases compensation in the form of alternative agricultural land was provided to farmers)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Impacts on valuable groundwater upwelling nature zones and valley ecotypes;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sedimentation impacts on the soil quality in the flood zones.</li>
</ul>]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Key EU legislation relevant to the plan has included: the Birds and Habitats Directives, the EIA and SEA Directives, and the Water Framework Directive and Floods Directive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The nature protection aspect was added to the Sigma Plan in large part due to obligations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. The expansion of Port of Antwerp, in particular the construction of the Deurganck Dock, led to the need for compensation of lost natural areas. In 2001, construction of the dock area was halted by court order due to its impacts on special protection areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive; a related issue was the poor quality of the environmental impact study. To continue the project, the Flemish Government approved an emergency decree that unblocked construction of the Deurganck Dock and called for nature compensation within the Kruibeke controlled flood area. This event, together with the ongoing need to comply with EU environmental obligations, contributed to the Flemish government’s decision to make nature protection the second pillar of the updated Sigma Plan that was adopted in 2005.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Individual Sigma Plan projects follow a stepwise plan that follows the legal procedures to obtain the relevant permits. The first step is to design a development plan outlining the zone uses, the exact contours of the controlled flood area, the nature types to be developed and how agricultural land will remain accessible. Next an environmental impact study needs to be undertaken detailing the impacts on surrounding people, effects on the soil and waterways and other impacts. Following the EIA process, and any changes it requires, then the regional land use plan (<em>gewestelijk ruimtelijk uitvoeringsplan</em>) needs to be adapted. Finally, planning permits (<em>stedenbouwkundige vergunningen</em>) are needed. Once all permits have been received the construction can be initiated.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sigma Plan was initiated in 1977 and was updated in 2005. The works under the updated plan will be completed in 2030. Additional works are planned for the period after 2030 depending on the extent of sea-level rise and/or climate change.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Temporary flood water storage in agricultural areas in the Middle Tisza river basin - Hungary]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The increasing exposure to floods is a consequence of the river regulation and land reclamation works that shaped the landscape in the Tisza River floodplain. During the last 150 years an extensive flood defence and water management infrastructure has been constructed. Climate and land use change in the basin are increasing the frequency and magnitude of floods. The Hungarian Government has been pursuing a new flood defence strategy for the Tisza based on temporary reservoirs where peak flood-water can be released. A plan to build six reservoirs was adopted, with the option to build an additional five. This case study is based on the analysis of operational scenarios of the reservoir schemes, while some of the detailed assessment took place specifically in one of the polders, the Hanyi-Tiszasülyi reservoir.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Near the geographical centre of Europe, the Tisza drains an area of 157,218 km2; the Tisza River Basin (TRB) has a population of 14.4 million. On its route from the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains to the confluence with the Danube in Serbia, the Tisza flows mainly through Hungary’s Great Pannonia plain. The topography of the TRB is characterized by high, narrow chains of mountains surrounding expansive, flat lowlands. With a length of 966 km and an average discharge of 794 m³/s the Tisza is the Danube’s longest and second largest tributary. Most discharge is generated directly from rainfall but there is a contribution from both snowmelt and subsurface soil water. Serious floods can originate from the mountains when rainwater flows quickly down the slopes and accumulates in lowland areas. This problem has become more and more serious over time as deforestation and soil sealing had progressed and precipitation patterns changed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The river and its tributaries were regulated in the second half of the 19th century. The main purpose of this regulation was to increase the extent of agricultural land, in place of wetlands, marshes and areas at risk of regular flooding (Borsos et al., 2010). The length of the river was reduced by over 400 km as the meandering sections were cut through, while the size of the floodplain area decreased by over 90% as dikes were raised to protect against floods. As a consequence, peak flood water levels increased. As a result of the impacts of additional factors, especially deforestation in the river basin, related increased sedimentation in slow flowing river sections and changing climate, as well as the fall back of agricultural activity in floodplains, peak water levels measured during floods continue to rise. Taking into account a few historical recorded flood events, peak water level was 753 cm in 1876, 909 cm in 1970 and 1040 cm in 2000 (Sendzimir and Magnuszewski, 2009).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Flood defence is based on the runoff capacity of the flood-water riverbed (the permeable capacity of the cross section between the dikes). This capacity has been increased step-by-step since the river regulation works of the 19th century to cope with the increasing peak levels of floods. Today, the length of the flood defence dikes along the Tisza and its tributaries in Hungary is 2850 km. The size of the protected territory is 16,000 km2, out of the total catchment area of the Tisza in Hungary of 47,000 km2. As the peak level of floods continued to increase during the last century and a half, so did the height of the dikes. A further rise of peak flood levels is projected for the 21st century as a consequence of climate change, and it is clear that the current level of flood embankments will not be sufficient to provide adequate protection. Flood defence exclusively as a result of enlarging and strengthening of embankments is estimated to be excessively expensive. In 1999 a World Bank financed research project estimated the cost of the remaining upgrade works to be HUF 175 billion, equivalent to EUR 700 million at a 1999 exchange rate (Szlávik, 2001).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">In the period 1998-2001 four serious flood events took place on the river Tisza with peak water levels exceeding all historical values. One of the events (2001) included the rupture of a dike, flooding areas that were supposed to be protected, thereby pointing out that neither the height of the dikes, nor their strength are adequate. Afterwards, a 4-year-long project was launched to investigate the validity of the flood risk projections used at the time (VITUKI, 2006). Besides applying novel methods of time series simulation processes and a revised historical hydrological database, the project considered the impact of changes (in forest cover, reservoirs, and flood embankments) within the different sections of the rivers passing through Hungary, including also climate change (Haase et al., 2006). The key conclusion of the project was that compared to previous projections there is increased uncertainty and higher expected water levels during floods. The land use change in the basin caused an increased surface runoff, while the modifications of the river banks caused an increase of the water speed in some parts of the river; these factors impacted on the height of the water level during extreme events. During an extreme precipitation event, a 100 years return period (an engineering measurement of probability to have an event of similar magnitude in a time period; in this case it indicates a probability of occurrence of one in a century) streamflow provoked an increase of the water level of around 70 cm, in comparison to earlier values of between 900 and 1000 cm. These values are expected to further increase as consequence of climate change. Koncsos (2006) also points to the role of mud accumulation in the river bed which considerably raises the level of water in a long time horizon measured in decades (average value of 0.77 cm/year) (Schweitzer, 2001).</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Adopt cost-effective measures aimed at ensuring an adequate flood protection level able to cope with the changing conditions of the river basin and the consequences of increasing peak flows. The implemented strategy was designed to respond to the changes in local climatic variability and specific characteristics of the hydrological system.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As a first reaction to the 1998-2000 floods the government decided to speed up the on-going process of strengthening the dikes: first plan focused on the reinforcement over a ten year period of 740 km of dikes in ten years. In the second stage, the governmental strategy intended to intensify the process further by strengthening an additional 550 km of dikes, but in a shorter period of 5 years. The works started, but suddenly the programme was stopped.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A new Act was designed in 2004 with the following objectives: to increase flood safety (partly) by the reactivation of former floodplain territories, the management of the water surpluses, the development of the regions with most disadvantageous status and the improvement of living conditions in these regions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">For the first period of the plan - from 2007 – the act called for the enhancement of the run-off capacity of the flood channel, the completion of 6 flood defence temporary reservoirs. It was designed focusing on strengthening the existing weak points of the dike system, the restoration of the run off capacity of the flood channel (the cross-section between the dikes) and proposed flood reservoirs, but only to reduce the peak of the biggest flood waves with a total capacity of 1-1.5 km3. The intention is to give room to the river using agricultural areas as temporary storage reservoir for containing peak flow during extreme events. The area is utilised for agricultural purposes in normal period, but could be eventually flooded and utilised for temporary retention of flood waters in case of emergency. This allows buffering during extreme precipitation events and reducing flood wave propagation, with consistent beneficial implications in terms of flood risk mitigation. The first reservoir was inaugurated in 2009, it was financed using national sources. All the other five planned temporary reservoirs were completed in the following years with financial support both from national and EU funds. One of the reservoirs was used in a 2010 flood event. From an engineering perspective the strategy proved to be successful, but some loose ends remain with respect to flood induced agricultural damages within the reservoirs.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The designed flood protection strategies were planned so as to be integrated into a wider process of regional development that projected large scale landscape and social rehabilitation efforts in combination with the restoration of the natural ecosystem of the region characterised by a complex system of wetlands. These initial goals were to include a wide, multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral participation in the strategy planning process. This has not been fully accomplished in the implementation phase. The flood mitigation project was designed with an approach aimed at minimizing the amount of agricultural land surface to be involved. In this way, policy makers tried to minimize the scale of potential conflicts with farmers and landowners that could represent an obstacle for the development of the project. The central government designed and implemented the plan including the flood-water storage reservoirs with the selected sites for the first six reservoirs chosen centrally. This decision was based on the adequacy of sites to be transformed into temporary reservoirs. Farmers and landowners had the possibility to accept the decision of the government or be subject to the expropriation of their land for public use. In this case, attending to the landowners interviewed during the research project, the sum paid out by the government was considered consistent with the market value. The government also adopted the rules for operating the reservoirs, including those associated with the compensation to be provided to land owners and users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">This case was analysed in the context of the EU FP7 funded project EPI-Water, Evaluating Economic Policy Instruments for Sustainable Water Management in Europe. The aim of this specific case study analysis was focused on designing a compensation scheme able to satisfy the requests of the agricultural sector and the needs of central government. The flood risk mitigation system based on the temporary flood water storage in agricultural areas is extremely effective for the purposes of disaster risk reduction, but might have negative impacts on the agricultural production of the affected areas. Flooding agricultural areas during crop production season could very likely result in the loss of the production in the affected areas for the year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">For the EPI-Water project, the participation of the stakeholders has been considered crucial. Landowners and farmers operating in the floodable areas and representative from the regional water directorate were involved in the development of a compensation scheme is able to more fairly compensate for the losses to the agricultural sector. There are multiple problems with the present scheme, making use of the reservoirs expensive for the government and, at the same time, leaves farmers and landowners dissatisfied. Among the others:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Compensation is not adequate in comparison to the real amount of damages. It compensates the yield losses, but it does not take into consideration soil rehabilitation and the financial consequences due to the disruption of the seasonal production cycle. These extra costs are particularly significant for high value cultivations.</li>
<li>Long time, up to one year in some cases, for the compensation process to be completed.</li>
<li>High unpredictability of the compensation scheme cost over time, with potential high impacts on the national financial budget.</li>
</ul><p>An increasing frequency of future floods, projected by the hydrologic models, is expected to increase the amount of damages to the agricultural sector. This could exacerbate the already delicate debate between local farmers and central government and increase the opposition to the construction of new retention areas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Active stakeholder involvement is fundamental to the process of developing a payment scheme that is more satisfactory for both parties than the currently existing process of compensation of the losses suffered by the agricultural sector. Through their involvement, the process and scheme gain additional credibility and acceptance of the effect of climate change on the future frequency of reservoir use.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has shown to be extremely effective in terms of flood risk mitigation. The retention of flood waters in the identified temporary reservoirs in the agricultural areas is crucial for the reduction of flood frequency and magnitude in the downstream areas, with considerable benefits for the cities located along the river. In normal conditions the retention areas are used for agricultural production. In case of emergency these areas are flooded and the farmers compensated for the losses. Unfortunately, as frequently happens in these cases, not all the stakeholders are enthusiastic about the solution adopted. Farmers claim inadequate consideration of their views and perspectives in the process that brought the government to use their land for temporary flood-water storage. Landowners are called to use their property for providing an important service, but they have not been involved in the design of the flood management strategy and the associated operating rules. In general, they are not enthusiastic about the reservoir concept.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The analysis conducted with the EPI-Water Project proposed to the parties (farmers and government) an Economic Policy Instrument based on a flat fee paid to the farmers plus compensation in case of flood. This scheme would have several benefits:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>Improved farmers’ financial compensation with a scheme that could be perceived as more transparent and fair, increasing the public acceptance of the flood management strategy;</li>
<li>Incentive for the farmers to reduce the amount of value exposed to flood events. This could be realised by a different use of the floodable areas, lowering the value of the crop at risk within the reservoir, making the whole scheme cheaper in the long run;</li>
<li>The proposed compensation scheme increases the management costs in the short run, but is expected to be cost-efficient in the long run;</li>
<li>The new management scheme could inform the planning process for new reservoirs. Public participation and farmer willingness to accept the operating rules could be a viable solution to reduce the implementation of new storage infrastructures.</li>
</ol><p>Stakeholder consultations revealed that representatives of the government are in favour of modifications aimed at improving the scheme, while farmers have mixed opinions driven by their specific conditions. However, although for different reasons both parties expressed scepticism about the viability and enforceability of long term agreements.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Several analyses have been conducted in order to assess costs and benefits of the chosen flood mitigation strategy. The solution of establishing temporary flood-water retention areas has been compared with other technically feasible solutions. The solution adopted resulted in an overall cost of around 260 million Euro, the strategy has been implemented with the contribution from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. The results of a comprehensive ex-post cost-benefit analysis (Koncsos 2006) have been summarised in the graph at the upper right corner of this case study sheet. This graph shows the expected present value of different flood-defence strategies’ costs and residual damages taking into account the cumulative impacts of flood events in 100 year-period in the Hungarian section of the Tisza River (source: EPI-WATER Project. Deliverable 4.2 - WP4 - Floods and Water Logging in the Tisza River Basin (Hungary) – Corvinus University of Budapest, REKK). The following notes should be considered when referring to the graph:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em>Values are in billion HUF, discounted at a 3% real discount rate. HUF 1,000 billion is equivalent to about EUR 4 billion. MÁSZ stands for the construction of dikes able to contain a 100 year return period flood;</em></li>
<li><em>Investment costs: cost of the hydraulic infrastructures proper of this flood risk mitigation strategy. In some cases the temporary flood water storage reservoirs are coupled with the increase of the dike height;</em></li>
<li><em>Defence operation cost: dike protection during high water level episodes;</em></li>
<li><em>Damage costs: compensation of the losses suffered by the agricultural sector and cost of reconstruction;</em></li>
<li><em>Eventual positive externalities of the strategy adopted (restoration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, etc.) have not been considered in the cost-benefit analysis.</em></li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the possible strategies has been designed as a scenario. The performance of each scenario have been ranked in terms of total costs: investment costs (building infrastructure: dikes, reservoirs), operational costs and residual damages. The implemented scenario, with 6 reservoirs and no modification to the existing dike system reduces substantially the risk compared to the baseline (no intervention). It represents a trade-off between efficiency in risk reduction and relatively low initial investment costs. The scenario designed based on the implementation of all 11 reservoirs was found to be the best performer in terms of cost-efficiency, but proves to be significantly more expensive to implement. The deep floodplain scenario is characterised by lower initial investment costs, but it was rejected by policy makers as it would have required a significant area to be modified in terms of land use. From a technical point of view, this solution lacks the flexibility of opening the flood gates only at the time of peak floods, but it would provide the most effective adaptation response to the projected changing conditions. The scenario analysis highlights also that further investments in flood defence infrastructures are economically justified. The only doubts are focused on the choice of the optimal strategy mix. The scenarios characterized by the lowest investment (VTT6; deep floodplains) are affected by the largest residual damage.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution of establishing the temporary flood-water retention areas is in line with the requirements of the EU Water Framework and Flood Directives. The integration of the two Directives is formulated in a way that requires the adoption of flood mitigation strategies more compatible with the natural ecosystems and the natural structure of the river hydraulic dynamics. This suggests solutions more oriented towards green infrastructures, such as the so called “room for the river”, and river ecosystems and wetland restoration. These strategies need large portions of land, typically used for agricultural production, to be implemented. The solution chosen for the Tisza River Basin is not a permanent river restoration strategy. It is designed to temporarily flood agricultural areas to provide space for the river (intentionally and under controlled conditions) in case of extreme events. Unfortunately the EU Directives do not provide clear instructions about the compensation for the impacts that the adoption of these strategies could have for landowners and farmers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">In this specific case, the current legal setup specifies the obligation to provide compensation to the impacted farmers, but its implementation left a considerable uncertainty with regard to the agricultural production process, raising the direct costs as well as the opportunity costs for the farmers. A more complex compensation scheme with more incentive towards adaptation is needed to meet the interests of the local populations (those benefiting from an increased level of flood protection) and the economic interests of the local agricultural community.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Multifunctional water management and green infrastructure development in an ecodistrict in Rouen]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The former industrial area “Luciline” in Rouen, along the Seine river, has been re-designed profoundly into an ecodistrict (9 hectares in total), including both climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions. Sustainable living is the core principle of the neighbourhood re-design. Sustainability aspects are implemented by means of energy, water, biodiversity, transport and planning solutions that in most of the case play an important role for climate change adaption or mitigation. Measures include: a system of small canals connected to the Seine river improving drainage of water from buildings (rooftops in particular) and open spaces, green areas and tree corridors, heating and cooling system using ground water (prior to its release to the Seine River), energy saving in buildings, good access to public transport, easy accessibility of the area by foot and bicycle and compact building planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project for the ecodistrict has won a climate adaptation award (Trophées Ademe 2014 “Adaptation climatique et territoires”) and received the official ecodistrict label of the French Department of Sustainable Development. Additionally, the city of Rouen received the label “Territoire à énergie positive pour une croissance verte" from the Ministry of Environment.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The re-design of the former industrial area of “Luciline” in Rouen into an ecodistrict aims to address, among the other, some of the typical climate change challenges that will affect urban areas, as: (i) increased temperature, contributing to aggravate the heat island effect, (ii) increased frequency and intensity of heavy rain water events and related impacts on stormwater drainage and management. The main challenge in the implementation of the project laid in its magnitude: the renovation of 9 hectares with multiple ambitious climate change adaptation and mitigation goals and the collaboration of the many involved actors and stakeholders was a complex and extensive mission.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the project was re-designing and re-developing a former industrial area into a sustainable new neighbourhood, providing residential, office and commercial functions. Sustainability has been considered the core principle of the whole project, expressed in terms of sustainable living, climate change adaptation, integrated water management, renewable energy production, climate change mitigation, sustainable mobility, limitation of urban sprawl, increase of green spaces. As a specific objective, the project aimed at minimising power consumption all over the process (from construction to management) and giving priority to solutions minimising maintenance requirements. The project aimed to achieve an official French “Ecodistrict” qualification and to become a “Ville de Demain – Ecocité”.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The former industrial area “Luciline” in Rouen, located along the Seine River, has been re-designed profoundly into an ecodistrict, including both climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions. The area covers 9 hectares and includes 1,000 new residential units, 30,000 square meters offices and almost 20,000 square meters commercial activities. Sustainable living is the core principle of the neighbourhood re-design. Sustainability aspects are implemented by means of energy, water, biodiversity, transport and planning solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several measures, like the water management system, are relevant for adaptation to climate change and climate variability. One of the main function of the water management system (formed by small water canals) is to improve drainage of water after heavy rainfall events; to this regard rainwater flows through the small water canals connected to wide ditches (where the vegetation is growing), then to a greater canal and finally to the Seine river. Domestic wastewater is treated in the general urban wastewater treatment plant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The water areas are combined with several green infrastructure measures. Three hectares of green public space have been created around water courses, corresponding to about 30% of the total ecodistrict area (9 hectares). At the same time water courses, that previously were channelled under the ground, have been uncovered to improve connection with green areas and biodiversity of their banks. Tree green corridors have been planted in order to decrease the urban heat island effect, as they can prevent part of the radiation from reaching the streets, thus creating a comfortable microclimate. A non-specified amount of vegetated rooftops will be created, which will help reducing the urban heat island effect and improve rainwater drainage. Moreover, the total area covered by buildings is minimised to 135,000 square meters, in order to create as much open space as possible, thus contributing to decrease the urban heat island effect and preventing urban sprawl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mitigation solutions focuses on renewable energy production and energy saving. An urban network is used for distributing water for heating in winter and cooling in summer. Relatively warm and cold water is provided by 6 sources from the deeper water layers (4-5 meters depth) of the Seine River (aiming to cover 60% of the heat supply). Three boilers powered by gas provide additional heating capacity. Energy saving is achieved by efficient building performance; buildings will be accredited with “very high energy performance” (40% less energy consumption than conventional buildings, and maximally 65 kWh/squared meter/year). Moreover, low-carbon transport and mobility is encouraged in several ways. 25 kilometres of quays and pedestrian and slow traffic pathways have been constructed. Additionally, three lines of fast public transport (including dedicated lanes for public transport) connect the neighbourhood with the transport system of the close (1.3 km) city of Rouen.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The dialogue with the population of the city is explicitly obliged by the framework of the “urban development zone” (ZAC) procedure. Therefore, public consultations have been organised in order to involve the civil society, i.e. citizens and their associations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wide number of actors have been involved in the realisation of the project. This was an initiative launched and co-organised by “Métropole Rouen Normandie” and the City of Rouen. The project is coordinated by the project development agency “Rouen Normandie Aménagement”. The Haute Normandie region also supported the project. European support has been received by means of the Future Cities project, which is part of the INTERREG IBV program and which received funding from the Fonds Européen de Développement Economique et Régional (FEDER). Substantial funding has been provided by the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The neighbourhood is subdivided in 13 building blocks (“ilots” – small islands), which are developed by different developers and architects. ADEME (the Environment and energy management agency) has advised the project on environmental and energy matters, for example in the development of a “heat fund” (Fonds Chaleur) to save money for future investments on the heat network. Advice has been given by EPF Normandie (Institution for public space development), CAUE (Architectural, urbanism and environmental consulting), OGI (Research &#38; development of public space) and H. Pénicaud (Environmental research). The heat distribution service is, after a public procurement procedure, awarded to the company GDF Suez Energie Services – Cofely for a period of maximally 25 years. GDF has to develop, build, finance and exploit the heat network.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Explicit and strong political commitment is named as one of the major success factors of the re-design of the former industrial area of “Luciline” into an ecodistrict. The political commitment was essential for the development and achievements of a project of this magnitude. The commitment of the city was not only strong in political terms, but also financially: they supported the project with about 28 million euros, which forms a substantial part of the total budget and thus helped the project in its success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiators (the city of Rouen and “Metropole Rouen Normandie”) of the project managed to obtain several different subsidies (e.g. INTERREG, Ville de Demain), which helped in achieving goals. Compared to the total budget spent, these subsidies are not the largest part of the budget, but they have been supportive for specific activities (further explained in the section “Costs and Benefits”). Moreover, the European project Future Cities, funded by INTERREG, improved the Rouen achievement due to the experience exchange with other cities, particularly Nijmegen (on planted roofs) and Arnhem (on urban heat island modelling).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project planning and organisation followed the Environmental Approach to Urban Planning methodology (Approche Environnementale de l'Urbanisme, AEU) of the advising company ADEME. This approach started with exploration of the areas and the identification of strengths, weaknesses, risks and priorities with respect to climate change. This phase was followed by the development of a general master plan and four focus areas: (i) contractual provisions for property concession, (ii) construction of a geothermal heat network, (iii) improvement of certain sections such as water management, climate change and urban heat effect, and (iv) raising public awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The involvement and consultation of many different stakeholders has also contributed to the project’s success, although it was also a major challenge to organise a project with so many parties. The coordination of different parties and discussions about their skills and limitations have improved the working process. The users have been involved in the development process in order to create public awareness and commitment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the project is supported by a monitoring and evaluation programme, in order to enable adaptive, flexible management, which is as a key factor in effective adaptation strategies according to the project’s report. This is most relevant for the urban heat system, because the optimal functioning of the system can only be investigated during its operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the limiting factors in the project was time management, due to the fact that before the start of the project there were still a few companies and private land owners in the area to be re-planned and re-designed. It cost more time than initially planned to organise the agreements with these land owners. As a solution for this time management issue, the project was divided in phases.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total project cost of only the Quartier Luciline is about 50 million euros, which are mainly composed of the acquisition, research and building costs. The cost of the heat and cold system is estimated at 5 million euros. After correcting for subsidies and prepayment by future customers, the net investment by the heat supplier (EDF) was 2.5 million Euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The major investor in the project was the city of Rouen; they invested 28 million euros in the quartier Luciline. Additionally, several European and national funding programs have contributed. In total, the project received about 2 million euros from European and national subsidies. The third important financer was the EPF Normandie (institution for public space development). The water management plan was partly funded by “Ville de Demain – EcoCité”; 0.7 million euros were funded by the state. The Luciline project participated in the Future Cities project, which is part of European programme INTERREG, which is funded by the European FEDER. Rouen received 0.6 million euros from this project. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has provided a loan of about 25 million Euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investment costs of the ecodistrict results in long-term benefits for the area. The main benefit of the project is that an abandoned area is transformed in an attractive area for citizens and companies, thereby making the area and the whole city more (economically and personally) appealing. Additionally, the new built apartments and offices are financially attractive for new users due to the lower energy costs.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The two major French environmental laws (Loi Grenelle I &#38; II) are followed by the project, which cover the national multiparty agreements about environmental measures. The project is connected to several major climate change adaptation policies in which the city of Rouen is involved, as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Agenda 21, "My city is my planet", adopted on 27 May 2011 and granted Agenda 21 Local France status in January 2012;</li>
<li>Territorial Energy &#38; Climate Plan adopted on 11 October 2013;</li>
<li>Covenant of Mayors, "For sustainable local energy", signed on October 2013;</li>
<li>The European label CAP CIT'ERGIE was attributed for these commitments on 30 January 2014.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Contractual provisions for property sales have been documented in a so called CPAUPE, stipulating architectural, urban planning, landscaping and environmental requirements for public spaces and private properties in the eco-neighbourhood. The partners who are building on the site have to comply with these stipulations.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Climate adaptation strategy for the Grimsel area in the Swiss Alps]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Settlements, infrastructure, land use and road connections in the Grimsel area in southern Switzerland are heavily exposed to risks from hydrological and gravitational natural hazard processes, such as rock fall, mudflows, landslides, avalanches, and floods favoured by sedimentation of debris. Permafrost thawing, glacier retreat, and more frequent heavy rainfall events due to climate change are expected to further decrease slope stability and increase likelihood of mass movements. The Grimsel area is located in the canton Berne at the north side of the Bernese Alps and comprises the two high mountain municipalities of Guttannen and Innertkirchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To cope with future challenges resulting from the combined effects of climate-induced natural hazards meeting upon pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities, regional actors engaged in a structured participatory process (2014-2016) and developed the ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel Area’ in the frame of a federal Swiss funding programme. The thematic scope of the strategy formulation gradually widened and shifted from an initially rather narrow focus on natural hazard management to broader perspectives of climate-resilient regional development. The final strategy document defines six concrete measures, of which one has been put into practise already in 2016: governance of strategy implementation has been institutionalised by establishing a steering group responsible for coordination and monitoring. By the end of 2018, realisation of further measures is showing a mixed picture, with the state of implementation ranging from finalized to being in progress to facing difficulties.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel Area’ responds to challenges resulting from the combination of i) climate change impacts on natural hazard potentials and ii) pre-existing socio-economic and socio-cultural context vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Grimsel area is characterised by high exposure to gravitational and hydrological hazard processes, such as rock fall, mudflows, torrential processes, landslides, avalanches, and floods through aggradation. In consequence of permafrost thawing and glacier retreat, different parts of the region have been affected by major natural hazard events involving mass movements on an annual basis and to an increasing extent in recent years. Due to the temperature-driven rise in elevation of the permafrost line, mobilisation of debris in consequence of glacier ablation, increasing likelihood of heavy rainfall events, and the rising snowline, it is expected that major mass movement events will become more likely also during the summer in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annual mean temperature in Switzerland has already increased by 2.0°C between 1864 and 2017, compared to 0.9°C globally (<a href="https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/swiss-climate-change-scenarios.html">CH2018, 2018</a>). According to the most recent Climate Scenarios for Switzerland 2018 (<a href="https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/swiss-climate-change-scenarios/technical-report.html">CH2018, 2018</a>), until the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century annual mean temperature over entire Switzerland may increase by up to 6.9°C since the pre-industrial era (5.4°C compared to the reference period 1981-2010) for the unabated emissions scenario RCP8.5. For the 2°C-compliant mitigation scenario RCP2.6, warming will likely be in the range of 2.1 – 3.4°C above pre-industrial levels (0.6 – 1.9°C compared to the 1981-2010 period). Even stronger warming is expected to occur in the summer season. In the long term, unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) will likely cause mean precipitation over Switzerland to decrease during summer and to increase during winter. Depending on the region, projected median increase in winter precipitation by 2100 ranges from +12% to +22%, and the median decrease in summer precipitation ranges from -10% to -24%. It is estimated that under the RCP8.5 scenario the zero degree level will rise by 700 to 1050 meters in winter (compared to 1981-2010). This will result in a likely decrease of snowfall sums by more than -50% and a decline of mean winter snow cover by -80% at low elevations. There is robust evidence that there will be more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, particularly in the winter half year, with the intensities of peak events showing the largest changes: for RCP8.5, rainfall amounts during day-long heavy precipitation events with 100 year return intervals are projected to increase by 10 - 25% until 2100. The combined effects of increasing winter precipitation, a rising share of rainfall instead of snow, and intensifying extreme rainfall events will have severe implications for the risk of flooding and other natural hazard processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Swiss national analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/publications-studies/publications/klimabedingte-risiken-und-chancen.html">Köllner et al., 2017</a>) has identified increasing frequency and/or spatial extension of mass movements due to glacier retreat and permafrost thawing, including in areas that were previously not affected, as a priority climate change risk for several Swiss regions, including the Swiss Alps. Without adaptation measures, decreasing slope stability and more frequent mass movements are likely to increase the risk of damage to human lives and material assets (buildings, infrastructure, indirect damages, decreases in storage capacities of water reservoirs) to a considerable extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Grimsel area, high current problem pressure from mudflows and local flooding in parts of the municipal territories was an important driver for initiating development of the climate adaptation strategy. In their assessment of future challenges, the participating stakeholders concluded that threats caused by a range of hydro-gravitational hazards are likely to increase under conditions of progressing climate change, including an extension of hazard-prone periods into the summer season (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Bender-Gàl et al., 2016</a>). The resulting risks directly affect the only cantonal road, which is the main public transport connection in and out of the region, the secondary road system, buildings and settlements, the supply infrastructure (drinking water, power lines, telecommunication), and facilities related to hydropower production, which is a main economic asset of the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change impacts on natural hazards are closely related to manifold issues of regional development in this peripheral rural area. Growing risks from natural hazard processes overlap and interact with other external pressures and socio-economic trends in force within the region, often exacerbating them. These non-climatic factors include: demographic change (rural out-migration, ageing of the population); limitations to settlement development due to natural conditions; limited public financial capacities for structural protection measures; impaired risk perceptions of the population (affecting perceived quality of life); dependence of attractiveness for tourism and of employment levels on continuity of the road connection. Climate-driven natural hazards influence these factors of regional development by affecting three key prerequisites of sustainable regional development, and by threatening their necessary balance, namely: i) transport connectivity and reliability of public infrastructure, ii) safety, and iii) quality of life.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Running within the thematic cluster “Coping with natural hazards”, the development of the ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel area‘ was one of 31 pilot projects funded by the first funding phase (2013-2017) of the federal <a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel.html">Swiss pilot programme for adaptation to climate change</a>. This programme supports implementation of the Swiss national adaptation strategy (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/strategie-des-bundesrates-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel-in-de.html">Federal Council, 2012</a>) by providing financial support for innovative and exemplary projects on climate adaptation in cantons, regions and municipalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pilot project in the Grimsel area aimed at sensitizing the regional actors for the consequences of climate change and promoting cooperation between relevant actors across levels and sectors. Concrete goals were to identify adaptation options, to develop a sub-regional, long-term adaptation strategy for coping with natural hazards in a coordinated way, and to achieve commitment of actors to its implementation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The strategy document is centred around four strategic directions for sustainable regional development under conditions of climate change: i) transport access, ii) quality of life, iii) safety, and iv) communication. For these, the following objectives have been defined (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Bender-Gàl et al., 2016</a>):</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><em>Transport infrastructure:</em> Adequate accessibility is ensured, taking into account cost-benefit aspects, while different qualities of traffic access are possible for different road sections.</li>
<li><em>Quality of life:</em> Optimal usage of the potentials of the region remains possible despite climate change. The tendency to out-migrate will not intensify despite the effects of climate change, and its consequences for the quality of life will be mitigated.</li>
<li><em>Safety:</em> Living in the municipalities remains safe, and inhabitants have a good feeling of security. Risks to people and property values are minimised.</li>
<li><em>Communication:</em> Communication within and about the region is easily understandable, well-targeted, adequate for the needs of each decision-making level, regular, occurring at the right time and through clearly agreed communication channels.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the strategy identifies five areas of interest and defines qualitative targets aiming at climate-resilient and sustainable regional development for each of them.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel Area’ (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Bender-Gàl et al., 2016</a>) recognizes that growing risks due to climate change and other on-going social developments are closely interlinked. It thus tackles climate adaptation and sustainable regional development in a coupled way (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Steinemann et al., 2017</a>). Accordingly, the strategy’s fields of action are partly directly related to climate-driven natural hazard processes and partly targeting also non-climatic influences on broader regional development. The strategy thus aims at securing climate-resilient regional development in a natural hazard and risk management context.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on assessments of the status quo, expected changes, resulting future challenges, and potential opportunities, the strategy document (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Bender-Gàl et al., 2016</a>) defines strategic directions and the following five areas of interest: (a) buildings, settlements and facilities; (b) cantonal road and infrastructure; (c) tourism; (d) employment and economic development; and (e) village life, socio-cultural aspects and landscape. For each of the areas of interest, potential action fields are identified, appraised, and prioritised, resulting in a portfolio of six concrete measures. These are defined in an operational way, including responsibilities, work steps, progress indicators, etc.. The measures are of different type and address: institutional settings, improvement of the knowledge base, settlement development, communication, marketing, and contributions to a technical solution. The following measures have been defined:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em>Establishment of a steering committee for the ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel Area’: </em>Constituting a steering group and defining its tasks and terms of reference in order to secure the implementation, monitoring and advancement of measures.</li>
<li><em>Conversion of unused real estates for residential purposes (municipality Guttannen, hamlet Boden): </em>Creating new housing space, attracting new residents, and promoting inward-oriented settlement development, in order to secure social and cultural village life and to preserve attractiveness of the area as living space despite the adversities of climate change. The measure responds to perceived losses of safety and quality of life due to climate-induced natural hazards and aims at counteracting out-migration fuelled by changing risk perceptions of the population.</li>
<li><em>Improving exchange of data and information on natural hazards:</em> Establishing an infrastructure and procedures for exchanging and processing data and information on natural hazards from various sources and for providing them to experts and the public. This shall support regional actors in coping with risks.</li>
<li><em>Preparing for possible new railway connection: </em>The measure aims at contributing to the recent political discussion on plans to build a new narrow-gauge railway, bundled with a high-voltage power line, in a 20 km long tunnel system passing north-south under the Grimsel pass. The project offers a ‘climate-proof’ alternative to the hazard-prone cantonal road. Possible implications of the project on the region and its exposure to natural hazards shall be evaluated and fed into decision-making.</li>
<li><em>Improvement of crisis communication for tourism: </em>Elaborating and implementing a tailored communication concept to convey in a more timely, accurate and effective manner information on occurrence of hazard events to touristic user groups.</li>
<li><em>Marketing of the natural environment and dynamic processes: </em>Developing tourism products that market landscape and the natural environment as regional assets. This shall also contribute to raising awareness of guests for natural hazard processes and to create better understanding for emergency measures such as road closures.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Implementing measure 1), the strategy has been structurally anchored in the region by establishing the steering group already in 2016. The steering group is part of a newly created governance arrangement for implementation of the strategy that builds on existing institutional structures in the region and combines central coordination with decentral responsibilities. It is composed of important institutions that participated in the strategy development and chaired by the Regionalkonferenz Oberland-Ost, an institution that is in charge of coordinating regional policy and acts at the interface of municipal, cantonal and federal authorities. The actors participating in the strategy development have committed themselves to implementing the strategy by signing a declaration of intention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of 2018, realisation of further measures is showing a mixed picture, with the state of implementation ranging from finalized to being in progress to facing difficulties: The touristic valorisation of natural hazard processes (measure 6) is running successfully and is bringing university courses, scientific excursions, and study visits of visitors from as far as other continents to the region. The improvement of data exchange on natural hazards (measure 3) among the region’s main infrastructure operators is progressing very well and has yielded substantial outcomes, e.g. regarding the redressing of redundant monitoring structures, common usage of databases run by single operators, and joint procurement of new monitoring systems. The body of arguments related to plans for a new railway connection (measure 4) has been prepared and communicated to responsible decision makers, but due to political decisions by the federal level the construction project has been postponed to a later point in time. Pursuit of measures 2) and 5) is currently delayed or on hold because crucial framework conditions have changed (new municipal government, personal change at actor responsible for measure).</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel area” has been developed in a participatory process running from 2014 to 2016. The involvement of all relevant stakeholders and the broad representation of important institutional actors in the working group has been identified as a key success factor of the project (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Steinemann et al., 2016</a>). Above all, the participation process succeeded in bringing together sectoral actors from different levels that up to then pursued separate risk management strategies in rather fragmented ways. The process organisation was composed of the project management, the working group, a sub-contracted external expert, and the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) as coordinator of the funding programme. The process management team was led by the Regionalkonferenz Oberland-Ost, which also acted as the project executing body, and included representatives of the engineering office of the cantonal administration (Oberingenieurkreis I) and of one municipality. Further partners represented in the working group included all municipalities, relevant cantonal offices, and both public and private actors representing the regional key sectors energy industry, transport infrastructure, tourism and agriculture. An external consultant was responsible for process steering, facilitation of meetings, and expert advice. Further counselling and expertise was provided by a climate adaptation officer of the funding body FOEN.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The strategy has been developed in a workshop-based process, which was structured in five phases. Starting with a kick-off event in May 2014 and ending with a closing event in January 2016, altogether six workshops have been conducted. They served to identify and deliberate on the actors’ needs and problem perceptions, systemic interdependencies, needs and options for actions, possible conflicts, strategy design, priorities and strategic directions, common goals, and concrete measures. The workshops were prepared and post-processed by means of input papers, which were gradually developed into the final strategy document.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bilateral exploratory talks, in particular before the first workshop, proved very useful to clarify the actual problem situation and to structure the discussion during the workshops. To some extent, these talks supplemented the workshops, in case limited time resources did not allow all participants to fully express all their concerns. The “world café” format proved a particularly suitable method to facilitate discussion in small groups within the workshops. Active participation in the process and positive identification with its outcome was promoted by inviting the participants to give inputs, e.g. on their interest group’s future vision, and by assigning responsibility for the development of measures to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stakeholder participation process was crucial to achieving the appropriate balance of measures within the stress field spanned by the strategic goals. This involved balancing acceptable risk levels with adequate levels of safety, accessibility and quality of life. In their lessons learnt (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Steinemann et al., 2016</a>), the process managers conclude that scientific facts alone are not sufficient for taking related judgments, but that it is necessary to develop joint positions by bartering different views and problem perceptions in a collective deliberation process.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel region’ is considered a success and a “good practice” project by the coordinators of the Swiss pilot programme for climate adaptation (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/publikationen-studien/publikationen/impulse-fuer-klimaangepasste-schweiz.html">FOEN, 2017</a>). It is among the minority of pilot projects that went beyond improving the knowledge base or developing support tools and proceeded to identifying concrete adaptation options, formulating them in a regionally anchored strategy and preparing its implementation in practice. The following main success factors related to different dimensions can be identified (<a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/klima/fachinformationen/anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprogramm-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel/pilotprojekte-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--cluster--umgang-0/pilotprojekt-zur-anpassung-an-den-klimawandel--klimaadaptionsstr.html">Steinemann et al., 2016</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Success factors related to external framework conditions:</em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Preceding hazard events in recent years had caused problem pressure at the beginning of the project, which created awareness of the need for action and increased the willingness to start a regional adaptation process.</li>
<li>A re-assessment of local flood risk during the strategy development process implied that the risk was less severe than had been originally assumed, which eased the problem perception of the involved actors. Although such dynamics may be seen as ambivalent, the changes in local risk perception facilitated a shift in scope of the strategy process from a rather narrow focus on (structural) risk management measures to much broader regional development perspectives.</li>
<li>The good availability of regional data on natural hazard processes at present and in the future was a favourable precondition.</li>
<li>Initiation of strategy development and choice of thematic foci were driven bottom-up by actors within the region and their regional needs.</li>
<li>Federal funding by the pilot programme was supportive. It signalled political will and relevance of climate adaptation at higher government level.</li>
<li>The overall Swiss tradition of inhabitants having strong civic roles and being used to acting in various societal roles at the same time proved a fertile substrate for participatory policy development.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Success factors related to the strategy development process:</em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Broad participation of the relevant regional actors from multiple levels and regionally important economic sectors, including key actors with good reputation and high credibility in the region. This also secured broad acceptance of the strategy.</li>
<li>Strong commitment of the process managers and high motivation of participating actors. Ownership of actors was fostered by allocating responsibility for development of measures to them.</li>
<li>Involvement of external consultants assured professional project management, attractive facilitation of workshops, and efficient preparation and post-processing of meetings.</li>
<li>Granting thematic flexibility to the process allowed reacting to changes in external framework conditions and opened up creative leeway.</li>
<li>The participating actors have committed themselves to implementing the strategy by signing a declaration of intent.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Success factors related to contents of the strategy:</em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>It has been a crucial success factor that climate-related natural hazards were dealt with in a broader regional development context, taking into full account their interactions with societal developments and socio-economic regional challenges.</li>
<li>It has been supportive that also the opportunities resulting from climate change and societal adaptation have been addressed. For instance, one of the measures seeks to take advantage of dynamic landscape processes shaped by changing climatic conditions by marketing them as an asset for tourism.</li>
<li>The strategy process has been institutionalised by establishing a new governance structure (steering group with terms of reference) for its implementation.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">It has to some extent been a <em>limiting factor</em> that group-based work with climate change scenarios during the workshop process was not successful. The initial idea was to differentiate problem assessments and adaptation options according to different scenarios of climate change (weak, medium, strong), so as to take account of uncertainties. It turned out, however, that this approach was too complex. Instead, the actors developed common appraisals of the general direction of future developments under progressing climate change (current situation improving, deteriorating, or remaining constant), which were not bound to a specific time horizon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While implementation of some measures has been achieved or is showing good progress, changes in framework conditions are currently negatively affecting other measures or limiting their impact. Despite preparatory steps for the conversion of unused buildings (measure 2), a political change of the local government has currently put the process on hold. A staff change at the actor responsible for measure 5) has so far delayed its implementation. The body of arguments related to the new Grimsel railway line (measure 4) has been completed and argued in favour of the project, but the federal government has in the meantime downgraded its priority.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the ‘Climate Adaptation Strategy for the Grimsel area’ was one of the projects funded by the federal Swiss pilot programme for adaptation to climate change. In its first funding phase, the pilot programme has funded 31 projects with a total funding volume of 7.7 million Swiss Francs. Excluding accompanying measures, this amounts to an average budget of approximately 200.000 Swiss Francs per project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For each measure defined in the strategy, the benefits and intended outcomes are described and financing needs are characterised in qualitative terms, but neither benefits nor costs have been quantified. Establishment and operation of the steering group did not cause any extra costs, because administration and work time are borne by the regular budgets of the member organisations. It has not been possible to estimate the costs of other measures at the time of drafting the strategy document, because in most cases the financing needs for full realisation of the measures depend on the outcomes of first implementation steps (e.g., clarifying the exact needs of various user groups regarding the planned natural hazard data hub). Accordingly, estimation of cost is sometimes part of the step-by-step implementation plan for measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Qualitative cost-benefit considerations played an important role in development of the strategy and are at the root of several measures. For instance, protecting the road infrastructure against natural hazards and increasing the quality of traffic access is restricted by the limited availability of public financial resources. The current focus of the public road management regime on monitoring hazard hot spots and preparing recovery measures if damages occur will thus have to be retained, because financing of larger structural protection measures is not feasible. Similar cost-benefit relations in the field of tension between risk prevention (adequate protection levels) and risk tolerance (acceptable risk levels) contribute to many of the challenges that the strategy responds to.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The contents of the strategy document and the adaptation measures defined therein connect seamlessly to the relevant municipal, cantonal and federal stock of legislation.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Implementation of the package of measures started in 2016, i.e. immediately after finalisation of the strategy document and the end of the seed-funding pilot project. The steering group for implementation of the strategy, as an institutional measure, has been established already during 2016. Some measures are by their nature rather open-ended, while completion of several other measures was originally planned until the end of 2018. Since some of these measures are delayed or facing challenges, they might become subject to re-scheduling or revision by the steering group.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Isar-Plan – Water management plan and restoration of the Isar River, Munich (Germany)]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This case study describes the flood risk management plan and the related restoration of a formerly canalized eight kilometer stretch of the Isar river in the city of Munich (the so called “Isar Plan”). Still in the beginning of the 19th century, the Isar river was a typical wild alpine river with wide gravel islands and sandbanks and a constantly changing river bed. In the middle of the 19th century after repeated flooding suffered by the Lehel, Au and Thal districts in Munich, hydraulic regulation began and the riverbed was canalized. Main aims of the Isar Plan were to improve flood control, biodiversity and recreational quality.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Continental]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One challenge related to climate change for the city of Munich is the expected change of rain patterns. Especially an increase in local heavy rain events is expected. Heavy rain events in the Alps in the years of 1999, 2005 and 2013 led to major floods and substantial financial damage in the South of Germany.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main aims of the Isar-Plan are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Improvement of flood control by increasing the water retention capacity of the river stretch in Munich;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Improvement of the habitats for wild species, considering issues related to: ecological upgrading of the river Isar, morphological processes, longitudinal and lateral continuity, natural habits for animals and plants, biodiversity and water quality.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Improvement of recreational quality due to the growing need for recreational space within a dense urban area, i.e. access to waterline, attractive landscape and views.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>More space and new banks for the river</strong></em></p>
<p>The formerly fixed, canal-like river bed has been transformed to a river bed of varying width with gravel banks and gravel stone islands which develop dynamically in a system of coming and going. Through the widening of the main channel from 50 m up to 90 m, incorporating the forelands along the river and the floodplains, average discharge and flood runoff has been improved and has given more space to the river. The steep embankments secured with concrete slabs and paving have been replaced with flat sloping banks and naturally developing banks. Technically designed cross-river sills with linear cross-section that are spaced at 200 meters with drops of maximum one meter cannot be passed by fish in most cases. These have been replaced by flat ramps with stone rock steps in a honeycomb design with intermediate pools. These measures not only restore a near-natural appearance of the River Isar, but also improve the living conditions and types of habitat for flora and fauna characteristic of the River Isar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Flood control: more essential today than ever before</strong></em></p>
<p>After restoration, flood runoff has been improved. Now, flood water can run off without causing damage at a rate of 1,100 cubic meters per second. In order to better protect lower-lying city districts from extraordinary high flood waters and the associated damage, an additional safety distance of one meter between the flood water level and the crest of the dyke had to be ensured.</p>
<p>In areas with reduced dyke safety, new dykes were filled in front of the old ones in order to maintain the air-side tree population. The water-side sealed embankment with its thin layer of top soil is an ideal site for species of dry grassland. By sowing indigenous wild herbs , spreading cut hay and transplanting sods with endangered plant species on the new dyke embankments and in the foreland, the scars left by the construction work in the first development sections quickly healed.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1995, an interdisciplinary working group “Isar-Plan” was initiated. Members were the State Office of Water Management Munich, the City of Munich (Department of Public Construction, Department of Urban Planning and Building Regulation and Department of Health and Environment) and the “Isar-Allianz” (an alliance of NGOs) The working group examined the flood-water situation, the need for recreational areas at the riverside and the area’s animal and plant worlds and their habitat. Based on their findings, the development goals were defined. The City Council and the District Councils were involved during the progress of the project. Public participation was ensured through: internet platform, info-brochures, excursions, workshops, TV and press, round tables, info-points, service telephone.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of cooperation achieved between all stakeholders involved within the Isar-Plan was excellent and one key success factor for the project.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 35 million euros were spent in total for the project: 28 million euros in construction costs, 7 million euros for the remediation of contaminated sites and the removal and disposal of weapons from the Second World War. The costs are being split between the Bavarian State Government (55%) and the City of Munich (45%). Main Benefits of the project include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Flood protection. The big flood of 2005 had a major impact in the whole catchment area of the Isar river. The restoration measures had a significant effect on the extent of the damages caused by the flood. Compared to other parts in the South of Germany, the flooding did not cause substantial damages in Munich due to the restoration of the Isar river.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Water quality. Also the Isar-Plan contributed to the improvement of water quality in the Isar River in order to achieve bathing water quality. The degree of effort that went in achieving bathing-water quality for the Isar was unmatched in Europe. All communities situated on the Isar have completed the process of upgrading their waste-water treatment plants to include UV germicidal irradiation systems. These measures have considerably improved the quality of water. Today, swimming is possible within the Isar River.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Water and land habitats. The widening of the riverbed not only led to an improved flow of flood water, but also created room for development and design measures on the banks. The Isar River now has more room to move and reshape itself along this entire stretch.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Recreational quality. The recreational quality has greatly improved, the restored Isar is, especially in summer, one of the favorite places of Munich citizens.</li>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Integrating adaptation in the design of the metro of Copenhagen]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change impact assessment has been an integrated part of the design and planning of the Copenhagen metro since the first metro line was designed in the mid-1990s. Apart from the first metro line, opened in 2002, and the extensions in the following years, which are partly subterranean, Metroselskabet, the Copenhagen metro company, is now constructing the City ring, an underground metro ring in the city centre of Copenhagen, which is scheduled to open in 2018. The biggest planning challenge is changing projections of increasingly higher mean sea water level as a consequence of climate change, meaning that entrances, ventilation (plus other infrastructure elements) to stations and shafts near the harbour and the coastline should provide sufficient protection against storm surges.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[design standard, storm surge, urban transport, metro, Copenhagen]]></field_keywords>
    <field_regions><![CDATA[Continental]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Both the subterranean part of the metro and the part above ground pose challenges related to climate change. The climate change impact assessment shows that heavy rainfall, storm surges and storms can impact the infrastructure, affecting the metro operation and passenger safety. Heavy rainfalls, storms and storm surge affect locally and are hard to predict as they can vary greatly within a short distance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The highest water level has been identified separately for each station in order to estimate the exact level for each entrance, stairs, tunnel ventilation, ramp, technique room, shaft, elevator, and control and maintenance centre. Apart from the track, the areas and installations mentioned are the most vulnerable that may affect the operation and safety, which should be ensured. As the basis for identifying the water levels for heavy rainfall and storm surges, a 2000 year event has been used, an event which is 5 % chance of happening in the metro life (100 years). Moreover, IPCC climate projections were considered as a basis for sea level rise. These projections have changed considerably from the planning of the first metro line until now, with consequences in the design of the elevation levels, as described in the “Solutions section”.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Protect the metro system against changes in climate, particularly from heavy rainfall, storm surges and storms, that could impact the infrastructure (mainly by flooding), affecting the metro operation and passenger safety.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevation level of critical elements of the Copenhagen metro stations (entrance, stairs, tunnel ventilation, ramps, technique room, shaft, elevator, and control and maintenance centre) increased from approximately 2.25 m on the existing metro to approximately 2.50 m on the City ring, which is currently under construction, considering the various IPCC projections available and their evolution in time. To adapt the infrastructure of the Copenhagen metro to the future climatic changes, several other actions have been identified and incorporated in the design of the metro, for example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The area around the entrances to the underground stations is designed to ensure the runoff of rainwater away from the openings. Furthermore, at some underground stations, a step has been incorporated, which requires a step up before you go down to the station.</li>
<li>All underground stations have pumping capacity to a so-called 1000 year event of rain. In the event that the tunnel is flooded, the water will automatically be pumped away.</li>
<li>Floodgates are established in 3 underground stations to secure the metro from flooding from other parts of the public transport train system.</li>
<li>In the above-ground metro system, drains are installed along the track leading the water out into the local sewer system.</li>
<li>The underground stations are protected against backflow from the city's sewerage system.</li>
<li>Installations of waterproof outer doors to the technique rooms at several stations as well as electrical and mechanical installations have been made them waterproof.</li>
<li>Technique rooms are installed with a 0.3 m raised doorstep.</li>
<li>Waterproof walls up to level 2.3 m and against waves up to level 2.55 m along the exposed above-ground metro sections.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Copenhagen has a similar problem to protect its low-lying urban areas where cultural institutions, government buildings, etc. are concentrated. The Municipality of Copenhagen is therefore elaborating general plans to protect the city from storm surges and as they are being implemented, obviously they will be included in the protection of the subway. Likewise, the Municipality of Copenhagen works on plans to protect the city from the consequences of ever more extreme rainfalls in the long term, which will likewise be included in the protection of the metro.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main institutional stakeholders in this project are the city of Copenhagen, the city of Frederiksberg, the National Parliament and the Ministry of Transport. The project is implemented by Metroselskabet, a partnership of the City of Copenhagen (50 %), the Danish Government (41.7 %) and the City of Frederiksberg (8.3 %). Public consultation, based on the Environmental Impact Assessment of the project, was conducted in 2008; 200 citizens voiced concerns about the project. The approval of the final project was made by the two cities concerned in January 2009, and by the Ministry of transport in March 2009.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors are: (i) Integrated approach, including flooding issues within the whole metro design concept since the feasibility stage; (ii) Building upon the experience gained during the design and operation of the previous metro lines (M1 and M2), respectively opened in 2002 and 2007; (iii) Consistency with city-wide adaptation plan to climate changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The main limiting factors concerns the planning and operation conditions originally established for the metro system, such as line layout and station locations, technical components, or rolling stock, to mention a few.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[CALocalHAS - An integrated analysis system for the effective fire conservancy of forests]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Fire is the most significant natural threat to forests and wooded areas of the Mediterranean basin. The average annual number of forest fires in the Mediterranean basin, particularly in southern Europe, is close to 50,000 - twice as many as during the 1970s. The natural plant ecosystem of the Mediterranean basin is rich in shrubs and coniferous forests and, thus, particularly susceptible to fire. Meanwhile, summer periods are now warmer, drier and longer and projected changes in the climate suggest increases in the frequency and severity of forest fires. A disaster risk arises when a hazard meets vulnerability. A key factor increasing vulnerability is the inadequacy of disaster-management planning. Recent forest fire catastrophes have revealed serious gaps in co-ordination, chain of command problems, and inadequate resource management and allocation. Often, information was not updated or was inadequate, leading to inefficient decision making.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">An important step in disaster management is the preparedness stage, which is directly connected with the reduction of risks. Evaluation of hazards, good planning, proper management strategies and co-operation are vital elements and were the main focus of the CALocalHAS project resulting in an integrated analysis system for the effective fire conservancy of forests.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In two pilots areas (Troodos, Cyprus; Grammos, Greece), the project aimed to:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Improve the knowledge and skills of civil protection professionals and services on effective temporal and spatial planning of resources;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Improve the knowledge and skills of decision-makers on evacuation planning;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase the effectiveness and readiness of fire brigades, civil protection, local communities and any other stakeholders to deal with forest fire threats.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The CALocalHAS project developed and established an integrated forest fire analysis system (IFFAS) for the effective fire conservancy of forests. It uses a forest-fire simulation tool that is capable of estimating the evolution of a wild forest fire. The tool does this by using as inputs data on ignition risk, real-time meteorological data, the vegetation of the area and spatial information (iso-contours and ground elevation).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Meteorological stations are installed in the areas of the two pilot sites (Troodos - Cyprus and Grammos - Greece) more subjected to fire risk and structural characteristics on vegetation provide detailed information useful to know when environmental conditions are favourable for fire development. The fire simulator tool is then used to predict fire development and to help in managing it.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Local authorities such as fire services, civil protection, local communities as well as private citizens were involved in the dissemination of the project results in order to deal with forest fire threats.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The system allows for the landscape characterization to manage the fire risk. The use of meteorological stations and morphological information provides detailed information on the environmental characteristics on the two pilot areas. It also involves local stakeholders such as fire services, civil protection and local communities so the information obtained with the application of the system were disseminated in order to discuss further strategies to cope with fire risk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">One of the limits of the system could be the ability of local authorities (civil protection, fire brigades, and decision makers) to apply the simulator and to manage the information obtained from it. To deal with this potential limit CALocalHAS project included the organisation of 5 (3 for Cyprus and 2 for Greece) training sessions on the use of the software. Furthermore the authorized users of the simulation platform were advised to contact the project’s team at any time, for any further information and help.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Integrated Forest Fire Analysis System (IFFAS) is a useful tool for the responsible authorities:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>At scenario level: (i) for personnel training purposes, (ii) for planning of the necessary fire conservancy infrastructures (fire monitoring stations, firebreak zones, water tanks, etc.).</li>
<li>At operational level: for decision making and coordination during forest fire incidents.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The only cost estimation available at the moment is related to the whole CALocalHAS project (2,337,114.00 €, EU contribution accounted for 1,158,803.00 €), that besides cost of IFFAS development included other costs, as those related to project management, dissemination, travelling, etc.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Ghent crowdfunding platform realising climate change adaptation through urban greening]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ghent aims at realizing more green areas in response to climate change and actively seeks citizen involvement to achieve this. This is in line with the city being very social and creative with many citizens actively developing bottom-up initiatives. Many of these small scale projects however have difficulty developing into a successful project through the available financing mechanisms. Therefore, Ghent has developed a crowdfunding platform that allows citizens to propose and finance their ideas for the city. Today, two projects addressing climate adaptation have been successfully realized with support of the crowdfunding.gent platform; one project encouraging urban farming and the other realising edible streets. The projects might seem small when it comes to addressing climate change challenges. However, the crowdfunding platform is found to be an excellent instrument to realise small ‘drops’ of climate adaptation measures that have the opportunity to generate larger ripple effects.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[Crowdfunding, vertical garden, citizen involvement, urban farming, sustainable food production, edible street, co-creation, green areas]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ghent, like many cities in North West Europe, is faced with the impacts of climate change. The city is experiencing negative effects due to excessive rainfall and rising temperatures. The average temperature in Belgium has increased with 2.2 °C since the pre-industrial period (source: <a href="https://klimaat.stad.gent/nl/gent-bereidt-zich-voor-op-onvermijdelijke-klimaatverandering">city of Ghent website</a>). The average number of heatwaves in Belgium has increased from once every 3 years to once a year. The city of Ghent itself is experiencing problems with heat-stress. A study on the urban heat-island effects in Ghent has demonstrated that additional green areas can help in addressing these effects (source: <em><a href="https://stad.gent/sites/default/files/page/documents/Hittestudie%20Gent.pdf">Maiheu</a> et al</em>., 2013). The city is therefore actively developing policies to enhance its number of green areas. Examples of measures that are especially encouraged are green roofs and urban trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To realise these measures Ghent is looking for opportunities to actively involve its citizens. Ghent is a very social and creative city where citizens are actively involved in developing bottom-up initiatives. However, many of these projects have difficulty developing into a successful project due to a lack in financial means and know-how. While both the city and society have funds available, the challenge is to make these funds accessible for small scale projects. Mainstream funding mechanisms, such as subsidies or tax incentives, is less suitable for these types of projects due to the required knowledge and conditions involved. At the same time the city wants to stimulate co-creation partnerships rather than fully funding the initiatives. In addition, the city wants to ensure that the initiatives that do receive funding are supported by the community. The challenge for the City of Ghent lies therefore in developing an instrument through which small scale initiatives can be financed, while keeping it accessible and offering the opportunity to involve multiple stakeholders.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Ghent has set out to develop a policy instrument to support the facilitation of co-creation, including its application for climate change adaptation. The instrument should be able to generate wider (financial) impact compared to subsidies or tax-incentives. Co-creation entails the involvement of multiple stakeholders. These stakeholders should have the opportunity to either contribute financially, through volunteer time or advertising the project. All these elements are crucial to a project’s success. The objective for the city of Ghent is therefore to develop an instrument that allows for the identification of ideas from the community as well as contributing to their realisation.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Ghent developed a crowdfunding platform that allows citizens to share their ideas and raise the necessary funds to realize them. Ideas can vary and include the increase of the city’s adaptation capacity. The person submitting an idea becomes a ‘project initiator’. This person needs to provide a short description and a funding goal for the project. People who provide financial backing to a project are known as ‘supporters’. Their minimum donation is €5. The donated amount per idea is viewed as an indicator of community support; only the projects with sufficient community support will become financially viable. The focus of crowdfunding.gent is on projects with a societal benefit, which sets the platform apart from other crowdfunding platforms. The platform was launched on March 16th in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Projects can be published on the platform through a straightforward process. Each citizen of Gent or person with an idea located in Ghent can submit a project by completing the crowdfunding.gent application form. The project becomes visible on the platform once it is approved by the platform manager, who is appointed by the city. He checks whether the project proposal meets a set of pre-defined requirements. Examples are “The project makes a positive contribution to the city or one of its neighbourhoods” and “The project must transcend individual interests”. The platform manager can provide feedback to applicants on how to enhance their project’s chance of success. The project is published once the applicant has made the necessary modifications. From this moment supporters can donate to the projects during a pre-defined period of time. Projects receive their collected donations within one month after the funding deadline as long as the amount is higher than €20. It is not a requirement to meet the pre-funding goal as past experience has demonstrated these projects can still be successfully implemented with a few amendments. In case of any modifications, the applicant is required to communicate to the supporters how their money will be spent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowdfunding.gent additionally offers initiators the opportunity to apply for a municipal subsidy of the project. The city has provided a fund of €55.000 per year specifically assigned to the crowdfunding platform. The request for municipal funding needs to be indicated in the original application form. Initiators can choose to apply for 25, 50 or 75% of municipal funding. To be eligible for funding, the pre-defined amount of co-funding needs to be raised. For example, a project that has applied for 50% of municipal funding with a funding goal of €1000 needs to raise at least €500 in donations by supporters. This condition is a means for the city to ensure that the project has sufficient community support. Whether or not a request is honoured is decided by an independent jury consisting of local experts. Per project the maximum amount of municipal subsidy that can be obtained is €5.000. The amount of municipal funding is at all times based on the pre-defined funding goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far two initiatives that have been submitted through the crowdfunding platform can be considered contributions to the city’s climate adaptation goals. These projects focus on sustainable food production and enhancing green areas. The first project “Lekker dichtbij!” establishes mini-gardens on balconies of social housing. Through urban farming more green areas are created contributing to mitigate extreme temperatures in urban areas. In addition, local food production reduces the need for long-distance transportation and therefore prevents an exhaust of carbon dioxide emissions. Urban farming also often requires less intensive agriculture as the farming is carried out on a smaller scale. In addition, Lekker dichtbij! enhanced social integration by stimulating cooperation between the residents from various cultural backgrounds. The project was successful in raising the pre-defined funding goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another project, “the Edible Street”, set-out to transform the traditional stone facades into vertical gardens to create additional green areas while stimulating local food production. Similar to the “Lekker dichtbij!” project, it contributes to the enhancement of green areas and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Although this project was not successful in raising the complete pre-defined funding goal, it was successfully implemented by scaling down the project. Instead of placing 100 planters in 5 streets, 88 planters were placed in 3 streets.</p>
<p>The small scale of the crowdfunding projects evidently only has limited impact in the context of addressing climate change adaptation. Indeed, these types of projects can mainly be seen as successes for the city’s ambition to realise more co-creation with citizens. Certainly, the crowdfunding platform seems an excellent way to realise small ‘drops’ in the context of climate adaptation that can generate larger ripple effects.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowdfunding.gent was developed by the City of Ghent with the support of an existing crowdfunding platform developer. No other stakeholders were involved in the development phase of the process. The citizens of Ghent and private investors are considered end-users of the platform. They can participate as either initiator of a project or end-user. The City of Ghent has appointed one policy officer to manage the platform. The city’s platform manager functions as the person to connect to the end-users. He reviews the project applications, takes care of communication with the citizens and manages the contact with the platform developer. His activities do not include financial transactions or platform maintenance activities. Maintenance activities are carried out by the platform developer. With regard to the municipal subsidies, the city has appointed a jury of local experts. The final decision on the composition of this jury is taken by the City Council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The platform mainly targets an online audience due to its set-up. However, ‘offline’ citizens do have the opportunity to reach the platform manager by phone or mail. He is available to fill-out the application form with them in person. A variety of communication channels have been utilized by City of Ghent to inform the citizens about the platform. These include flyers, the city’s official social media accounts and an article in the city magazine.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowdfunding platform has been successful in identifying ideas that are less suitable to be financed by subsidies. Reasons for this ineligibility can be the small amount of requested budget or a mismatch with the requirements or objective of existing subsidies. To ensure the maximum output, the city of Ghent did not define specific criteria that the projects need to meet. They rather focused on defining the types of projects they would not support. These definitions were then translated to a set of minimum conditions that the projects need to meet to be included on the platform. For example projects with a commercial aim or with an explicit religious, philosophical or political nature are not eligible for funding. Each application is manually reviewed by a policy officer to ensure the projects meet these requirements prior to publication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that the crowdfunded projects have the potential to create larger ripple effect is demonstrated by ‘the Edible Street’ project. The implementation of this project was quickly followed by a similar project in Kortrijk; Groene Straat (Green Street). This initiative finances the realisation of planters and other forms of ‘vertical green’ by offering bulk purchasing. The initiator based the project on a quick assessment of the core elements of the Ghent project that would allow a scaling-up of the project to a city level. The Groene Straat website describes 22 projects where additional (edible) green has been realised. Another project that followed the Ghent example is ‘Groenselare’ in the city of Roeselare, which started providing information to citizens on ways to create green facades after the city was named the most ‘grey’ cities of Flanders in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A limiting factor of this type of instrument is financial resources needed to build and maintain the platform. In addition sufficient man hours need to be made available for a city staff member to manage the content of the platform. Currently the City of Ghent has assigned one part-time platform manager. The platform is considered successful if 1 out of 3 projects reach their pre-defined funding goal. A 100% success rate would not be realistic as several success factors are beyond control of the city. For example, the project initiator is not necessarily an experienced project manager. In addition, it is difficult for the city to control the policy topics that the project proposals on the crowdfunding platform address. For example, more cultural than environmental projects were proposed in the first year of crowdfunding.gent. The use of crowdfunding as a policy instrument implies acceptance of the fact that the exact outcome cannot be controlled. On the other hand it offers a great opportunity to enhance innovation, cooperation and solidarity in a city.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The first year (2015) of the crowdfunding.gent platform has been successful in generating total revenue of €70.000. Of the total number of projects, 80% raised enough funding for implementation. So far 2 projects received an additional municipal subsidy. This subsidy amounted to a total of €1.480. The development of the platform involved both fixed and regular costs. Both costs have been covered by the city of Ghent. The costs were lower than the first year revenue collected by the crowdfunding projects. The specific IT-know-how necessary for the development and maintenance of a crowdfunding platform required the involvement of an external party. Next to the fixed costs, the city needs an internal project manager who can act as the central contact point on behalf of the city. This policy officer needs to be continuously involved in the project on at least a part-time basis in order for the project to run smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Private investors can become eligible to fiscal benefits when supporting a project of their choice. Organisations, such as companies, foundations, associations, are able to make a direct deposit onto the account of the project. This allows them to bring the expenses in as their tax deduction in a similar fashion as non-crowdfunding donations. A "regular" donation to a crowdfunding campaign is run through a platform account and therefore is not eligible for tax deductions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Ghent provides €55.000/year in funds to co-finance non-profit projects that achieve their funding goal through the crowdfunding platform. A jury of local experts takes the final decision on whether a project receives funding. The maximum amount of funding that can be assigned per project is €5.000. Projects that have successfully raised their pre-defined funding goal are still eligible for additional funding. An example is the project ‘Lekker dichtbij!’ This project ran for several weeks; it submitted its application in the spring of 2015, reached its funding deadline on June 14, 2015 and was implemented on June 19th, 2015. The project set €735 as its funding goal, but during the funding period it exceeded this amount by raising €822. The city of Ghent then co-financed the project for an additional €480. Even though the opportunity of additional public funding is offered, it does not seem to be an important motivator for project initiators to submit an application. In the first year of the crowdfunding platform only 2 projects applied for and received additional funding. Other benefits, such as publicity through the publication of the project on the platform, seem to be a more decisive factor in the consideration whether or not to submit an application.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The system of the crowdfunding platform is set-up in a way that it runs financially independent from the city. The city of Ghent has hired an external contractor to develop and maintain the platform. All transactions concerning the donations are handled by this external developer. The municipal fund of €55.000 (per year) is handled by the external contractor to ensure that it runs smoothly. The decision on whether to assign additional funding is taken by an independent jury of local experts. Project initiators who have been granted additional funding need to meet a set of requirements with regard to justification of the money spent. Within 2 months and 1 year of the end of a project, the responsible for the project needs to submit 3 types of documents. These include invoices of relevant items, a report that demonstrates the funding was used for the agreed purpose and an overview of revenues and expenses of the project. In addition, the city has the right to check at the project implementation site whether the funding is spent appropriately. In case the funding is found to be misused, the city can place sanctions on the project responsible. These sanctions include a recovery of the assigned amount of funding or even to exempt the beneficiary of the funding from receiving any funding in the future. The detailed conditions are laid down in the ‘Subsidiereglement voor het cofinancieren van non-profit crowdfundingprojecten “Wijs van Gent”’ (or: Subsidy scheme for funding non-profit crowdfunding projects "Crazy about Ghent"), which is publicly accessible on the crowdfunding.gent website.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The necessary regulation to realise crowdfunding.gent was implemented on April 1st, 2015. It is evaluated every 2 years. The project “Lekker Dichtbij” submitted its application to the crowdfunding.gent platform in the spring of 2015. The funding deadline was reached at June 14, 2015. The project was implemented on June 19th, 2015. The project ‘The edible street’” reached its funding deadline around the same time. The first “planter-placement-day” was already held in May 2015, before the end of the funding deadline. The money that was raised through the platform was later used to reimburse the participants.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Flood risk management for hydropower plants in France]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hydropower is an essential part of the energy mix in France, accounting for around 20% of installed capacity. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events and to accelerate snowmelt, which would result in increased flood risk. Flooding can adversely affect dams causing overtopping, outages, damage to equipment and adverse downstream impacts. It is essential that dam operators take these risks into consideration and implement adaptation measures as needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hydro Engineering Centre (CIH) at Electricité de France (EDF) developed the Piano Key Weir (PKW) system. The PKW system is an improved flood discharge system that helps to release water safely from dams during heavy precipitation events. The increased “crenelated” surface area of the PKW system provides an additional spillway to manage increased water flow. This is particularly relevant in the narrow gorges present in some of the alpine regions where PKWs have been installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are now 10 dams in France equipped with PKW technology and around 30 globally. The Malarce dam discussed in this case study was the 6<sup>th</sup> dam in France to be equipped with PKW technology for the purposes of improving water flow management. It is located on the Chassezac River in Ardèche in southern France.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Continental]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Releasing water safely from dams during floods or heavy precipitation presents a critical operational challenge. Past trends show an increase in extreme daily rainfall in southern France, which can lead to flash floods. This trend is expected to continue in the future. Snow and glacier melt are also expected to impact on dam inflow and outflow in the longer term. Glacier mass loss already shows a consistent acceleration across the Alps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge for flood management at hydropower facilities is to prevent or minimise the impacts of dam-overtopping on downstream communities, property, agriculture and ecosystems, while also protecting the dams themselves against operational failure and other damage. Each hydropower dam presents different risk levels and the effectiveness of PKW systems must be evaluated separately in each case.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The PKW system was developed in response to updated hydrological studies by EDF, which showed that extreme floods affecting hydropower dams were becoming more frequent and intense. PKWs help to adapt dam capacity to cope with climate change impacts such as increased precipitation and flooding. The objective of PKW systems is to provide an increased surface area for the (over)flow of water. This increases the discharge capacity of the dam without changing the maximum reservoir level. The primary benefit of such technology is to protect hydropower assets from damage, while also reducing operational costs compared to alternative gate systems. Other benefits include reducing downstream impacts during heavy precipitation events, as well as ensuring security of energy supply during such events through reduced operational failures.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The valley of Chassezac in the department of Ardèche in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France was identified as a high potential hydrological basin in the 1950s. This led to the development of five hydropower dams and four hydropower plants, which were all built between 1961 and 1970. One of these, the Malarce dam, has a height of 28.4 m, a length of 111 m and a withholding capacity of 2.3 hm<sup>3</sup> (i.e. 2.3 million m<sup>3</sup>). It became operational in 1968 and has a power capacity of 16MW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PKW for the Malarce dam was commissioned to increase its maximum discharge capacity by around 600 m<sup>3</sup>/s to a total of 4600 m<sup>3</sup>/s. When dam water levels exceed the level in the inlet tanks, water automatically flows over the PKW into outlet tanks that run straight into the spillway channel and downstream. This technology provides a means of adapting dams to increasing flood risks expected under climate change. The PKW in the Malarce dam helps to reduce the risk of costly damage to dam infrastructure and to downstream communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several engineering options available for managing dam spill over. Labyrinth spillways can only be installed in certain types of dams and must usually must be installed at the earliest dam design stage. Gated systems are in place in many existing dams for flow management. However, gated systems can fail in cases of saturation due to excessive flooding. PKWs often present the most effective option for flood risk management at existing dams. PKWs do not have a maximum capacity but instead provide a free flow spillway. PKWs can therefore manage much higher flow levels and provide a safer solution than gated systems, with minimal risk of malfunction and easier evacuation of floating debris. In contrast to other flow management techniques, PKWs also avoid human error, since they do not require human operators. This is helpful in emergency situations including flash flooding and landslides, during which workers cannot access the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The principal European players in PKW technology are France, Switzerland and Belgium. EDF did not patent the PKW system. Instead it has been working collaboratively to share the PKW technology and insights with other players in the international hydropower community. Indeed, indicating international recognition of the innovative technology, several developers around the world (e.g. in Algeria, the USA and South Africa) are also installing PKWs. In 2015, EDF received a Climate Solutions Award from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on the theme of adaptation.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since a PKW represents a small component of the overall dam, it does not have an explicit impact that is visible to or critiqued by stakeholders and NGOs. Therefore, stakeholder participation is not routinely an important part of PKW installation. Nevertheless, as with all major civil engineering projects, all PKWs follow strict environmental impact assessment procedures and need to receive government approval. These impact assessment procedures and approvals, for example through CODERST, include NGO and stakeholder consultations.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The PKW has been implemented in various hydropower facilities globally. This wide spread was facilitated by EDF’s decision not to patent this technology. The collaborative approach of the original developers, who shared the technology with stakeholders throughout the hydropower community, is one of the most important success factors of the technology. PKW is a cheap and easily installed solution compared to other overflow management technologies, such as gated systems. Furthermore, PKW technology is reliable and resilient since there is no need for manned operations or large scale maintenance. Finally, the fact that the first PKW was built by EDF, a well-known company that is well-respected in the hydropower sector, helped to convince other dam owners to install PKWs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges relating to PKWs include the suitability and accessibility of certain dam sites, particularly in mountainous regions. Furthermore, the long lifetime of hydropower infrastructure and the duration of the product cycles means that the spread of new ideas and technological solutions takes time in this industry. Finally, construction at dam sites usually takes place only in the summer months, which adds further constraints to the installation of PKWs.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of the PKW depends on the existing dam structure, location and also on the extent of water flow. Accessibility of the dam structure and associated equipment needs also impact on the cost. Depending on the dam, it may be more or less costly to install modifications such as PKW. Installation of PKW can cost between 200,000 and a few million Euros. In any case, the PKW can be cost-efficient, representing a relatively small component of the overall cost of the dam. Examples of PKW installation are routinely quoted as taking up to 30% of the total cost. While current gated system technology must be operated manually and requires expensive regular maintenance, PKWs do not require operating manpower and only low to no maintenance is needed.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no legal obligation regarding PKW in France and legislation in this area is not expected. It is up to the dam owners to install the technology. However, improved flood management at hydropower facilities does align with some of the principles of Directive 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management of flood risks.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">EDF developed the first PKW from 2003 to 2005 at the Goulours dam (Pyrenées Mountains). PKW implementation time varies on a case-by-case basis. Small projects can take a few months, whereas bigger projects can take a few years. In both cases, limitations arise due to the seasonal nature of dam construction work. Approval times are quite lengthy, involving preliminary study, detailed design, tendering, environmental studies and the approval of the authorities.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[New locks in Albertkanaal in Flanders, Belgium]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Albert canal in the eastern part of Flanders connects the industrial zones around Liege with the harbour of Antwerp. Ships can continue their way at both ends of the canal: via the river Scheldt to the Netherlands and via the river Meuse to France. In the future the Meuse basin, from which the Albert canal receives its water, is projected to experience more and longer periods of low river discharge, as a consequence of climate change, and so less water is expected to be available for sluicing ships. This would limit inland navigation. The solution to use less Meuse water for navigation are large (fish friendly) Archimedes screws at locks along the Albert canal. In the low discharges on the Meuse, the screws can pump back to the upper canal reach the water lost due to the passage of a ship through the lock. In the case of more than enough discharge at the Meuse, the screws are used as a bypass and to create hydroelectricity.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of climate change, Belgium is experiencing more and longer periods of drought. In the future this is projected to be aggravated. In the eastern part of Flanders one of Belgium’s biggest canals is situated: the Albert canal. This canal connects the industrial zone’s from the (French-speaking) Walloon part of Belgium with Antwerp, Belgium’s largest harbour. Ships can continue at both ends of the canal, to the Netherlands (e.g., Rhine, Rotterdam) and to France (Meuse). Because of the building of the canal also some important industrial areas were developed along it, making it an economically extremely important waterway for Belgium, with a total traffic of 40 million tons per year, avoiding 6000 trucks daily on the highways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The canal gets its water from the river Maas (Meuse), a river only fed by rain. The Maas is also feeding other canals, with the Juliana canal to the Netherlands being the most important. So agreements had to be established with the Netherlands to address situations of extreme weather events, including low water events. In some (rare) cases, the discharge of the river Meuse is not enough for feeding all canals in Flanders and the Netherlands and for maintaining a minimum discharge in the Meuse itself. During these periods, the water level of the Albert canal can drop, so that the allowed draft for ships has to be reduced, making inland navigation less attractive as transport mode. Up to now these problems were addressed by a number of measures, such as lift-locking of professional shipping with less water and limiting water withdrawals for agricultural and nature management purposes, but these measures implied accepting associated economic and ecological damages.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the measures described in this case study was to avoid economic damage due to reduced traffic possibilities on the canal (due to very low water discharge from the Meuse river), which are expected to be aggravated in the future because of climate change. Protecting ecosystems was another important objective.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end different problems, possibilities and advantages were merged into one remarkable solution. Big Archimedes screws were built at the locks in the canal in Ham, the first of 6 lock systems. In case of drought these enormous screw pumps, the biggest in Europe, are pumping up water lost by the passing from the ship through the lock. In case of an excess of water, mainly in winter, the screws are used as a bypass to get rid of the excessive amount. In that case the pumps work as an electricity generator, with hydropower as renewable energy reducing GHG emissions. The net effect on GHG emissions over time depends on the balance between low and high water levels, but since low water levels occur only rarely, the net effect is generally positive. The canal is also a possible waterway for migrating fish. Therefore the screws are designed to allow fish migration, protecting biodiversity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The installation in Ham (2012) consists of four enormous screw pumps with 4.3m diameter and weighing 85 tons. The screws can pump up to 5 cubic meters per second. One lock operation moves 48,000 cubic meters of water. The four screws need 50 minutes on full power to pump back the water. In 2013, three similar screws were installed in Olen. In the coming years (from spring 2017), similar screws will be installed in the locks of respectively Hasselt, Genk, Diepenbeek and Wijnegem.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The organization “NV de Scheepvaart” resorting under the policy area “Mobility and Public Works” has searched for solutions together with its partners. Two major preparatory projects led to the eventual design of the measures, in which relevant stakeholders were involved. The first was the development of a low water strategy for the canal. In a first, problem analysis phase, an inventory was made of different water uses, consulting water users about their ideas to reduce water use. In a second phase, different possible solutions were proposed, inviting feedback from all relevant stakeholders. In the third phase the effects of the solutions in terms of effectiveness and costs were analysed quantitatively with a suite of models and other analytical tools. In a fourth and final phase, in a series of workshops preferred strategies were discussed with a broad range of stakeholders using water from the canal system for economic, ecological or societal reasons, including industries, shipping representatives, drinking water supply companies, power companies, nature protection organizations, municipalities and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second project was an environmental impact assessment, on the basis of which the preferred option was chosen from the proposed solutions, taking into account various environmental dimensions, notably fish stock interests and noise.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Important success factors included the acknowledgement of ecological values and the attention to the development of a collaborative process in which all stakeholders were seriously engaged. As to the former, two ecological factors played a key role: the structural possibility to protect natural values in the Meuse valley by limiting extraction of Meuse water and maintain a sufficiently high run-off level, and the consideration of the fish stocks in the Albert Canal. As to the latter, the process of developing of the measures has shown that in order to arrive at broad support research is needed, but also sufficient time for the stakeholders to cooperate, share knowledge, understand each other and get to know and respect each other’s culture. Imposing solutions or taking insufficient time would have limited success. One of the main factors of success to collaborate was the awareness of the inadequacy of current solutions and projected worsening of the situation in terms of frequency and length of low water levels.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of the installation of the screws is about 7M€ for each lock system. The benefits include the navigability of the canal under changed climatic conditions, the reliability of the canal for shipping also enabling of fish migration, and the generation of electricity. Green electricity (hydropower) for an equivalent of 1000 families will be produced by each set of screw pumps. On the basis of hydrological analysis, including climate change, it is expected that the installation will function as power generator for about 10 months per year and pump up water for about one month, with one month stand-still in situations of just sufficient run-off for shipping but insufficient for power generation. On an annual basis much more energy will be generated than used, the precise annual power generated depending on the amount and spread of precipitation over the year, the evolution of shipping intensity and the withdrawals of other water users. There are also biodiversity benefits. Because of the relatively high water quality rich fish stocks exist in the Canal. Advanced technologies used for the pumping installations and power generation minimizes the impacts of the installations on the fish stocks.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A legal agreement was established between Flanders and The Netherlands about the water availability in the river Meuse. In particular, this agreement addressed the water extractions from the Meuse by the Zuid-Willemsvaart in Maastricht; the reduction of water losses in the Meuse in case of low run-off, collaboration on research and development of the common Meuse, and compensation of fresh water losses of the Kreekraksluizen.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The first set of screws were installed in 2012 in Ham and are fully operational. The second set of screws are implemented in Olen and are operational in 2015. Four more sets of screws will be installed in different lock systems.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Private investment in a leakage monitoring program to cope with water scarcity in Lisbon]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisbon is located in Southern Europe, a region that is generally identified as one to be likely affected by droughts if current climate change scenarios do occur. Over the last 40 years, Lisbon geographic area has witnessed an increase in the rainfall variability. Projections up to the end of the century agree that these trends will intensify. Leakage reduction at the distribution network arises as one of the most significant adaptation measures to be implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres (EPAL), the oldest water utility company in Portugal, has developed a leakage monitoring program to optimize the water supply efficiency of Lisbon’s distribution network. The program identifies and locates potential leakages by comparing datasets of water use (expected vs. real-time use). It has made the water supply system more efficient and profitable by preventing non-revenue water (i.e. leaked water): the cumulative savings for EPAL since 2005 amount to around €68 million.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[leakage monitoring, water efficiency, distribution network, Big data, non-revenue water]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisbon is likely to face a decrease in annual rainfall and an increase in frequency and duration of drought periods, with projections for minimum and maximum temperatures pointing towards an increase for the end of the century of about 3°C, as anticipated by regionalized climate scenarios developed by the ADAPTACLIMA-EPAL project funded by EPAL and implemented by the CCIAM Research Group (Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation Research Group) of Lisbon University. Due to its subtropical-Mediterranean climate, the city generally experiences short, mild winters and hot summers. It is therefore vital for the city to pay attention to its water efficiency. Portugal has experienced severe droughts in the past. Droughts pose a risk to human health as high temperatures can result in dehydration. The most recent major drought event occurred in 2005; however, Lisbon consumers did not experience major consequences at the time due the resilience of water source availability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reducing the leakages from the water distribution network and the amount of ‘non-revenue water’ can significantly contribute to Lisbon’s ability to cope with future droughts by increasing the city’s water use efficiency. The non-revenue water represents the difference between total input volume and authorized billed consumption, i.e. the water lost/leaked in the water supply system. During the 1990s the annual non-revenue water level in Lisbon was on average between 25% and 30%, around 40,000,000 cubic meters. An additional stress factor on the water distribution system has been the growing demand for drinking water due to urban population growth. Today, the network supplies water to around 350,000 domestic and commercial customers within the inner city and around 2,500,000 people in the Greater Lisbon area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main challenges to respond to augmented drought risk is, therefore, to keep non-revenue water proportion of the city’s water supply network at the low levels achieved in recent years.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Lisbon set out to find a way to reduce the volume of water lost due to leakages, also known as non-revenue water. The main source of this problem is linked to faults in the pipelines due to the aging of the infrastructure. EPAL has specialised technicians in-house to carry out any necessary repairs. The difficulty, however, lies in identifying and locating the faults as the network is widespread and mostly underground. Whether a technician needs to search for the leakage within an area of 1 square meters or 1.000 square meters can make an enormous difference. EPAL therefore decided to develop the monitoring program WONE through which water leakages could be identified more quickly and located more precisely. Its initial aim was to realise a reduction of non-revenue water from 25% to a level below 15%, to provide a long term sustainable water supply by improving day-by-day efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To address the water leakages, EPAL set out to develop the water leakage detection program WONE. The program is based on a monitoring system that is able to identify and locate any water leakages in the distribution network. The monitoring system allows the comparison of expected water usage data to real-time water usage. This comparison is carried out by a software that was especially developed for the program. When a discrepancy is found between the two datasets, it alerts the monitoring team that there is a potential leak in the system. The location of the leakage is identified by tracing back the water meter that provided the data that showed a deviation. After the location of the leak is identified, specialized technicians, known as leak detection mechanics, are sent out to carry out a field-based leak detection and repair the problem. The program has resulted today in a reduction of non-revenue water from 23.5% in 2005 to around 8.5% in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The WONE monitoring system is based on a partitioning of Lisbon in water zones defined considering the number of inhabitants, also known as District Metered Areas (DMA’s). Each zone consists of 3,000 to 5,000 clients and functions as a strategic metering area. In each zone water pressure is continuous monitored through a passive system with active alarms. WONE software conducts a continuous performance evaluation of the DMAs by combining data of several databases and calculates performance indicators to control non-revenue water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was developed as an in-house R&#38;D project. It started initially as a pilot in a selected number of ‘simple’ zones. Based on the results of this pilot, the program was further refined and expanded to a larger number of zones. In the first year of development 20 zones were included in the program. In the subsequent years the program was expanded with 30 to 40 zones annually. Today the system is operating in all 158 zones. Next to the water meter in these zones, customers can be provided with water meters through the program on request. These ‘private’ water meters have allowed EPAL to gain further insight into the water usage of its customers, based on which the company can now provide additional consultancy services. These services can include on-site detection of leaks or client advisory to improve water efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team monitoring the WONE software plays a key role in its successful application. This team was created by recruiting 4 University graduates, who are still part of it today. Each leak detection technician received specialized in-house and on the field training (that included 2 weeks of on-job training with foreigner companies, generally in United Kingdom). All subsequent knowledge was developed on the job. The consistency of the team has contributed to the successful build-up of a large in-house knowledge base of water efficiency monitoring over the 10 years the program has been running.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contribution of reduction of water lost to the sustainability and resilience of the water supply system is not limited to the water resource itself. Indeed, the reduction in water losses also contributes to EPAL’s climate mitigation goals through energy use reduction. Both the operation of the water pumps and the purification of water require electricity, thus emitting greenhouse gasses. The water pumps ensure a continuous flow of clean water through the system. When a smaller volume of clean water is needed, less water needs to be circulated and therefore the total amount of energy needed to keep the water distribution system in operation is directly impacted.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The WONE program has been developed and continues to be managed by Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres (EPAL), which is the oldest water utility company in Portugal. EPAL is the main operator of the water distribution network in the country and is a state company that is fully owned by the national public holding company Áquas de Portugal (AdP) since 1993. EPAL is responsible for the management of the water distribution activities as well as the maintenance of the distribution networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EPAL has implemented a set of measures to prepare the system to cope with reductions in water quality associated with more intense drought periods and contaminants’ run-off, higher temperatures and reduction in average annual flow, if climate change scenarios will occur, such as the refurbishment of Vale da Pedra water treatment plant, to adapt treatment processes, in order to respond to a wider range of water quality variations With regard to water efficiency and demand management, the company has given significant steps in terms of awareness raising, such as the launch of campaigns promoting the correct and responsible use of water and by creating and providing apps and tools for consumers’ self-control, to increase household water efficiency (e.g. Waterbeep). EPAL’s strengthened in-house processes and competences have made possible for the company to establish a set of critical climate changes indicators and to monitor them periodically on a perspective of system’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EPAL has also promoted the project ADAPTACLIMA-EPAL, which has been scientifically supported by the CCIAM Research Group (Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation Research Group) of Lisbon University. This study, funded entirely by EPAL, aimed to provide the company with an adaptation strategy to reduce the vulnerabilities of its activities to climate change. The project focused on adaptation options to increase the resilience of EPAL’s systems against risks associated with climate change. One of the options presented was the promotion of actions for the efficient use of water, which supports the objectives of the WONE program. The ownership of the data and documents from the research project was transferred to EPAL at the end of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Lisbon does not have any direct involvement in the WONE program. The city has received advice from EPAL on how to improve their water efficiency and has made large investments to realise these improvements. As the activities of the WONE program do take place within the city area, the city also acts as a facilitator for the construction works that need to be executed on site. In addition, Lisbon facilitates any necessary WONE program communication between EPAL and the citizens and companies of Lisbon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The citizens and public and private companies are the customers of EPAL and therefore both drivers and end-beneficiaries of the reductions in a water bill. Next to maintenance of the water distribution network, consumer behaviour is a main driver of water usage reduction. Therefore EPAL provides additional consultancy services to customers who would like to improve their water efficiency. These consultancy services can include the provision of a monitoring system, the identification of leaks on site or water efficiency advisory. Water efficiency through consumer behaviour has a limited impact on the annual income of EPAL. Each sold cubic meter of water needs to cover the costs to prepare and distribute it, which means that its profitability is limited. The income of EPAL depends more on the fixed service cost that is included in each water bill. A reduction in water consumption by customers is therefore of interest to both the customer and EPAL.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The WONE program has proven to be successful in improving the resiliency of the water distribution network, while also realising a profitable business due to considerable savings in costs. Compared to the baseline in 2005, the savings accumulated to date are around 136 million cubic meters. The WONE program should therefore not be considered as just an investment in climate adaptation. It also offers a very interesting opportunity as a business investment that has provided EPAL with a strong economic incentive to ensure the long term resilience of its distribution network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Support of the management board of the company has been proven to be an important success factor, as well as the involvement of other key areas of the company, namely network operations, maintenance and customer relations. These operations aim to promote a change of mentality within the company. The development of the WONE program received a lot of support within the company from the start. The extreme drought in 2005 led to a higher awareness of the risks involved in droughts. This is illustrated by the creation of a Drought Commission within the Ministry of Environment directly after the 2005 event, which emphasized the importance of cooperation among national entities and between Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The WONE program focuses on the detection of leakages only. Therefore the results of the data analysis need to be well attuned to the practices of the technicians, who need to find tailored solutions to repair the actual leak. This translation from data to action still requires a human act, which means that its success is very much dependent on the knowledge of the team operating it. Within the WONE program a pleasant working environment has been realised and that has so far resulted in a steady operational team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The water distribution network needs to be continuously monitored and improved. Usage of the water distribution system means that its pipes will ware and eventually need to be replaced. The average lifespan of the network amounts to 50 to 60 years. The advantage of the WONE system is that problems can be identified more efficiently, which means that the replacement of the network can actually take place in phases. The renewal and repair of water pipes is therefore a continuing process. The WONE program makes it manageable by focusing on continuously fixing smaller parts of the network, rather than replacing it all at once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can be difficult for cities to take the initiative in realizing a water efficiency program as the role of cities is limited to being a facilitator and customer of the water company. To carry out a water efficiency program is in the first place an investment decision that needs to be taken by the water company itself. Cities could stimulate this type of development through a ‘lead by example’ approach by improving their own water efficiency. They can also support in the communication between a water company and citizens by promoting awareness of the project among citizens and providing practical contact options.</p>

    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial development of the program was financed through in-house financial resources of EPAL. The return on investment for leakage repairs has been highly profitable for the company and could therefore be considered an R&#38;D investment. The total investment for the software development was around €1,000,000, as well as a similar amount that was invested in network monitoring systems within the city. The operational costs of the program account to about €500,000 per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the program the amount of non-revenue water has decreased from 23.5% in 2005 to around 8.5% in 2015. This has resulted in around 68million € in accumulated savings in the last 10 years. The water efficiency program is thus highly beneficial in terms of its cost-benefit ratio. EPAL decided to then reinvest the achieved savings into further reducing the company’s environmental impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The leakages can affect both the ‘public’ pipelines as well as the ‘private’ pipelines owned by the customers. In the first case it means that the water loss is accountable to EPAL. The company therefore directly saves costs by fixing the leakage. In case of private pipelines, the costs saved by fixing the leak are at the benefit of the customer. In this case the profit of EPAL remains more or less the same; however, the customer is still paying the fixed service charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of the WONE program does not include the costs for the renewal of the water distribution network, which is considered a ‘regular maintenance’ costs. To finance these costs, the AdP and EPAL have received financial support through favourable interest rate loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) since 1993. Their support was used to finance water supply extensions and upgrades, waste management measures, sanitation networks and efficiency improvements. The EIB has supported loans of almost €2,500,000,000 in Portuguese water networks. The EIB has built a long trusted relationship with EPAL since it started financing its projects more than two decades ago. This relationship is maintained through the provision of annual progress reports about new concepts and methodologies by EPAL to the EIB, as well as updates on the related international and national programmes.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The WONE project is compliant with the National Program for the Efficient Use of Water (PNUEA), which is coordinated by the National Laboratory Civil Engineering. This program aims to contribute to a new approach for tackling water issues in Portugal under a framework of sustainable development. It has been subject to several updates in line with the relevant European directives. Under this program it was identified that water waste associated with water distribution systems was still very high in 2009. At this time EPAL had already obtained considerable experience with the reduction of non-revenue water and therefore served as a leader in water efficiency efforts through its WONE program. Recently, PNUEA has relaxed the 2020 reduction target for non-revenue water from 20% to 25%. This reduction has already been realised in Lisbon with non-revenue water levels consistently under 10%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The alignment of the National Water Law and several Community Directives provided EPAL with the right to collect a Water Resources Tax. This tax is designed to cover the costs associated with planning, protection and management activities of water resources. In addition, the city introduced a sewage tariff charge, which is used to cover the costs of the construction, maintenance and renewal of the public waste water system and the disposal of waste water.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Flexible and adaptive coastal planning and protection approach in Aurich, Lower Saxony]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The rural district of Aurich in Lower Saxony is the northernmost district of Germany, bordering the Netherlands and the North Sea. Its natural environment is characterised by the Wadden Sea, by three islands off the coast and by more than 70km of coastline. Dominant habitats include coastal wetlands and inland moors and swamps. Large areas of the Aurich District are protected, the Wadden Sea National Park of Lower Saxony being only one example. In addition, large areas lie below sea level, both on the islands as well as a strip 2 and 15 km wide behind the mainland coast. Consequently, coastal protection has always played an important role in the district. Tourism and agriculture are the main economic activities with the economic importance of renewable energy production increasing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change is expected to result in sea level rise and seasonal increase of storm events and precipitation including more extreme rainfall events in winter. These projections are posing serious challenges for coastal protection (drainage of low-lying areas, risks of flooding from rivers and sea), water services, agriculture, conservation and tourism. The Coast Climate Project undertook an approach to implementing Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) in the District of Aurich, with the goal to come to more integrative and flexible solutions for coastal protection. Furthermore, the purpose of the project  was to adapt existing planning frameworks to the challenges of competition for space between use functions, which is expected to be aggravated by climate change. Stakeholder participation in group interviews and workshops was used to identify conflicts of interest among use functions and to identify potential measures supporting the implementation of ICM. The project was funded by the German Agency for Environment and conducted by two institutes, Ecologic Institute (Berlin) and Raum &#38; Energie. The project, focusing on the case study in Aurich, was carried out between January 2013 and February 2014 and resulted in a political decision concerning the implementation of concrete adaptation measures. The development of several concepts has been decided, as described below. Moreover the implementation process was initiated through strengthening existing networks for ICM and creating new ones.</p>

    <field_sectors><![CDATA[Coastal areas]]></field_sectors>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Aurich is a rural district, which is characterized by coastal lowland and wetlands. The area is vulnerable to flooding as a consequence of storms and heavy rainfalls. Regional climate models and climate change effect projections were used to identify likely trends in the district with regards to temperature, precipitation, storm intensity, water balance and sea level rise. A seasonal increase in precipitation including more heavy rainfall events and storm intensity in the winter has been predicted. Similarly, the water balance is expected to shift towards the winter months. The forecasted sea level rise lies between 26cm and 82 cm to the end of the century. A rise in flooding magnitude and frequency is very likely an, according to predictions, the area of flooding will increase. Hence, the district of Aurich is threatened by flooding originating from both land and sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This poses serious challenges in the fields of coastal protection, conservation, agriculture and water services, and conflicts about the use of space are likely to develop between these different activities. The following list summarise the different challenges caused by climate change in the district of Aurich per sector, as identified during group-interviews with experts in this case study:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em><span>Coastal protection</span></em>: Increased occurrence of damage to dikes, harbour and transportation infrastructure, and coastal infrastructure; High costs associated with coastal protection measures; Decrease in mud flats.</li>
<li><em><span>Water services</span></em>: Drought stress in agriculture and conservation; Drainage in the face of rising sea levels and increased frequencies of events with high precipitation rates; Water supply on the islands while freshwater aquifers are shrinking and sea level is rising.</li>
<li><em><span>Agriculture</span></em>: Change in precipitation rates: droughts and events of high precipitation; Changes induced by shifting species composition; Increasing risks associated with crop yields due to extreme events; Increasing amount of conflicts on spatial use; Limited capacity of spatial planning to take influence.</li>
<li><em><span>Conservation</span></em>: Increased drought stress impacting on habitats adapted to high humidity; Conflicts with agricultural sector about the production of biomass for renewable energy; Conflicts with the water services sector and with drainage interests.</li>
<li><em><span>Tourism</span></em>: Use of the opportunities generated by climate change; Impacts from deterioration of water quality; Impacts from increased intensity of storms that will cause more ocean debris to accumulate on beaches; Increased drinking water demand during summer months.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In discussions, the problems of drainage of the low lying areas and the provision of clay and sand for coastal protection measures were identified as the most pressing challenges.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal of the “Coast Climate” Project was to identify options to address conflicts of interest arising from climate change and to identify potential synergies jointly with local stakeholders. In a pre-assessment exercise in which the main issues arising from climate change effects in the area were identified, the thematic focus was placed on problems with drainage of low lying areas and conflicts regarding the spatial planning of clay and sand abstraction, as both problems were considered particularly important for the project and the needs of the stakeholders due to their high complexity and conflict potential with other use functions. Possible solutions were identified also in view of the parallel efforts of the District of Aurich to develop regional spatial planning programs which take into account climate change. Reciprocal effects between clay and sand abstraction, drainage and other use functions and stakeholder needs were also taken into account in the analysis.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Inland-drainage</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In expert interviews, desk research and stakeholder workshops the following solutions were identified:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Use of mobile pumps as a flexible response to events of high precipitation.</li>
<li>Remote control of pumps.</li>
<li>Increase capacities of pumps.</li>
<li>Combine pumping stations with wind energy installations to improve energy supply.</li>
<li>Transform closed (/blind) drainage systems (particularly abundant in settlements) into open drainage systems, which are more resilient to fluctuating amounts of drainage water.</li>
<li>Incorporate and identify possibilities to retain water in order to mitigate peaks in drainage/flooding.</li>
<li>Shift the focus from pumping water to storing it in diked areas. Possible options for this include widening up of ditches, increasing height of dikes bordering tidal outlets, usage of new tidal outlets.</li>
<li>Create room for flooding by establishing reed areas bordering the drainage canals (also beneficial for nature conservation).</li>
<li>Transform former clay and sand abstraction sites into water storage areas.</li>
<li>Use retention areas/reservoirs/areas designated for flood protection also for production and saving of energy (synergies with conservation possible).</li>
<li>Make use of tools such as ‘eco-accounts’ and ‘area pools’ for the reservation of areas and the up-front implementation of conservation measures, which can function as compensation of negative ecological effects of future measures. However, it is due to the initiative of communities to use these tools as they belong to soft law.</li>
<li>Conduct research to enhance prediction of events of strong precipitation, so that adaptive measures can be targeted more accurately and conflicts avoided.</li>
<li>Awareness raising on the scarcity and importance of space and associated use conflicts.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Relevant events and related milestones to progress in the inland-drainage topic include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Round tables (twice a year) with representatives of the following sectors: agriculture, nature conservation, water management association, planners, renewable energy. Related milestones are: (i) concept for the transformation of closed drainage systems into open systems by end of 2015; (ii) concept for the combination of pumping stations with wind energy installations to improve energy supply by 2017.</li>
<li>Round table of regional and Länder administration to find ways of including needs for a better inland drainage into existing legal frameworks. The related milestone was identified in: providing a wording to support an open drainage system within the current spatial planning program of Lower Saxony (LROP, 2008) until 2015.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Sand and clay extraction</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In expert interviews, desk research and stakeholder workshops the following solutions were identified:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Follow an integrative approach in order to avoid/ mitigate competition for space between sand- and clay extraction, agriculture and conservation.</li>
<li>Participation of all sectors in spatial planning for abstractions (e.g. informal working groups).</li>
<li>Improve data sharing on demand, occurrence and availability of clay.</li>
<li>Acquisition of prior purchasing rights of areas by the district of Aurich, implementation of a leasing scheme for dike- and water associations (weaker dike- and water-associations would need financial support by the state).</li>
<li>Explore alternative sources of clay (e.g. from dredging activities).</li>
<li>Construction of groynes as a means for promoting the sedimentation of clay and sand. The accumulating outland could function as dike support (conflicts with conservation sector).</li>
<li>Thoroughly assess &#38; make use of possible synergies between uses, e.g. the use of former clay- extraction areas as retention areas/reservoirs (consider trade-off between needs of flood-protection and conservation).</li>
<li>A freely accessible cadastre collecting relevant information of possible re-use of areas.</li>
<li>Implement a pilot project on the re-use of areas after the extraction of sand/clay.</li>
<li>Integrate existing efforts of integrated coastal zone management by the state of Lower Saxony.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The relevant event to progress in the sand and clay extraction topic include was identified in a roundtable of regional and Länder administration on re-use concepts. Related milestones are: (i) concept for the re-use of extraction areas behind the dike taking into account the interests of nature conservation and agriculture, by 2016; (ii) in parallel development of a cadastre with all available information as basis for decisions on reuse of the areas.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In its search for integrative and flexible solutions for ICM and climate change adaptation, the project followed a participative set-up with a strong focus on stakeholder interviews and interaction during workshops. The method used was structured in 4 distinct phases:</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group interviews with experts</span> </em>in June 2012. In June 2012, the first group interviews with experts were held in Aurich District. The purpose of these interviews was to identify the relevant topics and actors. Invited experts were representatives of the district administration, the state of Lower Saxony and associations (for dikes, drainage and agriculture). As the need for action at the time was most pressing in these fields, drainage, clay-and sand abstraction were identified as the most important issues, and the following workshops were thus directed to these issues.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desk study: Establishing the information base</span></em>. To enable focused dialogue processes and to produce a common contextual information basis, during a second phase an independent expert team of two consulting institutes, subcontracted by the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), analysed the impact of climate change, the aims of and potentials for climate protection, existing planning instruments and concepts with regard to climate protection, adaptation, coastal protection and ICM, as well as specific problem constellations and conflict situations in the case study region.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Workshop on CoastalClimate</span></em>: Future strategies for coastal development facing climate change in September 2012. During a workshop in September 2012 with an extended group of participants, possible courses of action were identified for dealing with the spatial conflicts and challenges which result from the need to expand drainage, clay-and sand abstraction in response to climate change.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In-depth expert interviews</span> </em>(starting in January 2013). The results of the workshop were further developed by means of in-depth interviews with both external experts and experts who had previously participated in project activities. Apart from the elaboration of the results from previous project activities, the purpose of these interviews was also to include the state-level perspective on project results, and to obtain comments from and draw parallels with other states in Germany.</li>
</ol>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The engagement of a variety of stakeholders during all project phases and in the decision-making process, assuring a comprehensive approach and a commonly accepted solution.</li>
<li>Consistency of stakeholder meetings, due to the relatively small numbers of stakeholders.</li>
<li>Inclusion of climate change adaptation measures into existing development plans of local municipalities and on state level.</li>
<li>Continuous stakeholder meetings support the motivation to keep on with activities even though a project ends and no funds are available in the near future.</li>
<li>The interest of the stakeholders to participate in different projects provided the opportunity to develop ICM guidelines on state level.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Main limiting factors include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Lack of financial capacity: in district administrations like Aurich, costs are often the main argument for not implementing climate adaptation measures, as the benefits are not clearly visible in the short term. Cost-benefit analysis could provide a useful tool here, but is not often used at this administrative level.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Lack of expertise regarding funding instruments.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The resources for the project were relatively limited (approx. 40.000 EUR) and mainly went for the organisation of workshops and the preparation of reports and flyers. The participation of local stakeholders was not paid and was only possible for those who were sponsored by their institution or for individuals on voluntary basis. In general it is difficult especially for representatives of small administrations to participate in a series of workshops without getting funded.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Local representatives often do not get back tailor-made solutions for their problems, which lowers their motivation to participate in other projects/workshops.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Existing programs for financing climate protection and adaptation measures on national and European level require matching funds (see also 2.6 for an overview of existing funding mechanisms on EU level, national level and of the federal state of Lower Saxony), and this has limited their potential uptake.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Aurich case study is an example of how, with very limited financial means, an improvement of coastal management towards a more integrated approach as well as the consideration of climate adaptation was achieved. This was due to the small, highly motivated circle of stakeholders as well as to the general strong network in the region working on a day by day basis on several non-ICM issues. Above all, the work on the Aurich case study was supported and channeled by the ICM platform of Lower Saxony. Therefore, local stakeholders are continuously working on these topics and see projects as helpful support. New for the stakeholders were organized workshops. These workshops conducted during the project have resulted in the formation of a community of stakeholders and ICM practitioners from different administrative levels who have continued meeting also after the lifespan of the project has expired. Furthermore, light was shed on the integrated nature and spatial dimension of problems such as sand-and clay abstraction and drainage, and the need for integrative approaches and flexible measures has become clear during the exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the measures identified in this case study, data on their costs and benefits are difficult to find for the specific scale and area of the project. However, an approach on how to conduct such a cost-benefit analysis and what could be the results is provided by a study conducted for the German Environmental agency UBA: A cost-benefit-analysis for 28 case studies on climate adaptation measures was conducted (see also Tröltzsch et al 2012). For the construction of dikes and beach nourishments with a time horizon of 2085, the study found the benefits to be higher than the costs by a factor of 2.5. Despite the usefulness of such data in political decisions, care needs to be taken in their interpretation, as an important factor in estimating costs and benefits of climate adaptation measures is the uncertainty of possible effects of climate change. The degree of security associated with the cost-benefit estimation for dike-enforcement and beach-nourishments in this study was estimated to be moderate.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The policies which were assessed during the project and were found to be important building blocks for ICM and guiding coastal development in the case of Aurich are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Land-Use Planning Policy of the federal state of Lower Saxony</span></em></span><em> </em>(German abbreviation: LROP). It contains binding land-use plan for the whole state of Lower Saxony. Updated from 2009-2012 with provisions on land-use for the implementation of climate protection and precautionary regulations for flood protection as part of climate change adaptation. A package of regulations for integrated coastal management is also part of this policy. Year of inception: 2012; Legal status: fully binding.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Regional Land-Use Policy</span></em></span><em> </em>(German abbreviation: RROP). It concretizes the provisions of the LROP for the regional level and function as a link to municipal land development plans. Issued by districts as the lowest entity of regional planning (such as the district of Aurich) and revised every ten years, these policies also devise areas for clay-and sand- winning. As of 2006, a strategic Environmental Assessment is necessary for the RROPs. Status: The RROP of Aurich is awaiting a thorough update. Until then, the version from 2008 (including an update from 2012) stays valid; Legal status binding.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Land-Use Concept for the Coastal Sea of Lower Saxony</span></em></span><em> </em>(German abbreviation: ROKK). It formulates statements on land-use based on the LROP, complying with and cross-cutting through the RROPs of all coastal districts within Lower Saxony. The ROKK functions as an important ICM building block, as it offers information on different use functions and conflicts in the coastal sea and provides measures to solve these conflicts and to promote sustainable development. Year of inception: 2005; Legal status: spatial planning provisions non-binding.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The following list includes an overview of the commissions and platforms in place which are important for ICM in the case area of Aurich:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>Governmental Commission of Lower Saxony for Climate Protection</span></em></span>. The commission functions as think-tank for the proposition of components for the Climate Protection Strategy of the State of Lower Saxony. Year of foundation: 2008. Degree of formality: voices recommendations for a climate protection strategy for the state of Lower Saxony, not binding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>ICM Platform</span></em></span>. Platform for information exchange and networking concerning ICM, chaired by the government of the city of Oldenburg. The platform has produced a web-based interactive map displaying relevant ICM activities in the coastal zone of Lower Saxony. Local actors can enter projects and information into the map. Year of foundation: 2013. Degree of formality: offer from the government of Lower Saxony, not binding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span>German-Dutch Commission for Land-Use Planning</span></em></span>.

    <field_title><![CDATA[Zaragoza: combining awareness raising and financial measures to enhance water efficiency]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Zaragoza Water Saving City programme was initiated in 1996 in response to water scarcity. It included awareness raising campaigns, the implementation of examples of good practice and voluntary public commitments by citizens and businesses. The water tariffs were revised to provide disincentives and incentives that ensure a full cost recovery whilst maintaining affordability for low income households. The programme also involved improvements to the water distribution infrastructure to reduce the waste of water. After 15 years the city achieved a reduction of water consumption by almost 30%, mainly due to changes in water use behaviour and is now known throughout the world as a leader in the field of water conservation. The city participated in the SWITCH project (Sustainable Water Management Improves Tomorrow’s Cities’ Health; 2006-2011) to further reinforce the commitment of the city to manage its water resources sustainably.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Zaragoza is the fifth largest city in Spain and the capital of the Autonomous Community of Aragón, with a population of around 700.000 inhabitants. This is a semi-arid region with an average annual precipitation of only 314 mm, most of which falls during the cold winters. Consequently, water shortage is a serious issue for the municipality. This was made obvious in the early 1990s when a prolonged drought resulted in water restrictions that caused public anger and political fallout at a national scale. In the future, the number of consecutive dry days is projected to increase significantly in southern and central Europe, in particular in summer, thus possibly exacerbating the problem of water scarcity.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Zaragoza decided to take action addressing the water management to satisfy the needs of the developing economy and the future demands of a growing population (the population of Zaragoza is projected to reach one million shortly after 2020.). To do so, the city moved away from continued exploitation of limited resources to curbing water demand and limiting the leakage from the distribution networks. Water scarcity, particularly a drought in the early 1990s, has been an important consideration, but financial and economic considerations were also drivers.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Following water shortages in the mid-1990s, the municipality of Zaragoza increased its water supply and managed demand by developing a “water saving culture”. The Municipal Strategic Plan 1996-2010 set out an ambition objective to reduce total city water consumption from 84.7 Mm3 in 1995 to 65 Mm3 by 2010. A municipal Water Commission was established by the City Council in 1996 to oversee the implementation of a range of ambitious long-term water saving initiatives. The Zaragoza Water Saving City programme was initiated in 1996 by the NGO Fundación Ecologica y Desarollo (FED) with the municipality support. The programme was implemented through the following phases:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Phase 1: “Small steps, big solutions”; A widespread awareness-raising campaign to reduce water consumption within homes, public buildings and commercial activity through behavioural change and water saving technology.</li>
<li>Phase 2: “50 good practices”; The implementation of 50 examples of water efficient technologies and practices in parks, gardens, public buildings and industry to demonstrate performance and encourage uptake on a wider scale throughout the city.</li>
<li>Phase 3: “School for efficient water use”; The dissemination of pocket guides among the city’s major water consuming sectors describing the good water saving practices identified in Phase 2.</li>
<li>Phase 4: ‘100,000 commitments’ – The invitation of citizens and businesses to make online public commitments to save water in time for the International Expo "Water and Sustainable Development" which opened in Zaragoza in June 2008.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Another initiative to reduce water consumption in the city included a review of the water tariffs structure to make it more equitable and demand-responsive, with the aim of achieving full cost recovery through revenues, including the direct costs of service provision as well as indirect costs within the water cycle more generally. This was done through:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>equitable charging, ensuring that the cost of water is related to the benefits it delivers to the user;</li>
<li>affordable access to basic water services for all, including the availability of subsidies for vulnerable households (pensioners, unemployed, large families);</li>
<li>an incentive for the consumer to use water efficiently, in the form of water bill discounts rewarding households that were able to reduce their annual water consumption by 10% or more;</li>
<li>penalising excessive consumption with higher prices.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The final part of the programme was targeting leakages from the city’s aging water supply pipelines. Considerable investments were made in controlling water losses, including rehabilitation of the pipeline network (189 km from the 1,246 km of the network have been renovated), pressure management controls and much needed maintenance to leaking storage tanks in the basements of apartment buildings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results of this comprehensive campaign reduced the water consumption from 180 litres per capita per day (lpcd) in 1980, through 136 lpcd in 2000, to just under 100 lpcd in 2010. In terms of the overall water savings, the city exceeded its own target: in 2009 total water consumption was 59.9 Mm3. Thus, 15 years after the start of the campaign, the city achieved a reduction of water consumption by almost 30 %, despite a 12 % population increase in the same time. In response to these achievements, new goals have been set that aim to reduce per capita consumption of potable water in the city to 90 litres per person per day and overall consumption to 58 Mm3 per year by 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bulk of the achievements were due to changes in water use behaviour, largely brought about through the awareness-raising and promotional activities. As early as the first phase of the Water Saving City programme, the percentage of citizens aware of potential water saving measures had risen from 40% to 72%. Other initiatives such as the control of leakage from the water supply distribution network also played a part. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of pipe bursts reduced from 750 to 350 in 2010, and losses from the system as a whole were reduced by over 40%, meaning that almost 20 Mm3 of water were saved each year. The review of tariffs was less influential in reducing the water consumption but nonetheless had a large economic impact on water services. Whereas in 1997 income from water consumers covered around 70% of the cost of supply and wastewater disposal, the equivalent figure in 2006 was closer to 90%; well on the way to achieving the goal of full cost recovery. This has allowed much-needed investment to be in made water services infrastructure, particularly wastewater treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results allow to conclude that combining changes in water use behaviour, water efficiency technology and reduced leakage can generate sufficient savings to make new and costly water supply infrastructure unnecessary. It also made the City of Zaragoza more resilient to future droughts and water scarcity associated with climate change.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of reducing water use by all types of consumers required the cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders. The stakeholders participating in the initiative included the City of Zaragoza, the Zaragoza Water Commission, which itself is made up of representatives of different municipal departments, citizen groups, organised civil society and other stakeholders, non-governmental organisations (Ecology and Development Foundation, the Foundation for a New Water Culture (FNCA) and the San Valero Foundation), businesses and local residents. Working closely with stakeholder representatives allowed the identification of realistic and acceptable water conservation measures and took advantage of existing channels of communication to reach out to members of the different target groups. Providing citizens with the information, means and incentives to actively commit themselves to saving water raised awareness about the benefits of contributing to the overall conservation goals of the city.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The success of this approach appears to have largely depended on the implementation of the following actions:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Working directly with stakeholder representatives.</li>
<li>The establishment of a central coordination unit: rather than being a collection of fragmented, individual initiatives, the setting up of the Zaragoza Water Commission provided effective coordination of consultation, implementation and evaluation of the different activities, with the aim of achieving a common goal.</li>
<li>Encouraging public participation: domestic water consumption was identified as a key area where significant water savings could be made and this drove the involvement of the local residents in the work of the Water Commission.</li>
<li>Targeting specific sectors: instead of promoting generic water saving messages, awareness-raising activities targeted specific user groups with information that was directly relevant for their business or lifestyle. The production of dissemination guides for different consumer types also resulted in explicit benefits and incentives of reduced water use to be clearly outlined and promoted.</li>
<li>Leading by example: high-use groups and the general public were likely to ignore awareness-raising campaigns if they felt that the authorities responsible for water were not equally committed to improving their own performance. By providing an efficient and reliable water and wastewater service, businesses and residents were more inclined to contribute themselves.</li>
<li>Gaining political commitment: key stakeholder consultation and public participation to reduce water consumption in Zaragoza was specifically mentioned in the municipal strategic plan, with the implementation of many activities taking place through Local Agenda 21 commissions. A supportive city council allowed policy commitments to be made, increased the availability of funding and provided the means to generate public pride in the city’s achievement through events such as Expo ‘08.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Participation of the city in the following projects was also relevant:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">"SWITCH - Sustainable Water Management Improves Tomorrow’s Cities’ Health", undertaking innovation in the area of integrated urban water management in 12 cities across the globe to further reinforce the commitment of the city to manage its water resources sustainably.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Optimizagua - a Reference Model for the Efficient Management of Water (LIFE 2003 ENV/E/000164) shortlisted as best environment project by the EC.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aquanet (ES/07/LLP-LdV/TOI/149053), which resulted in a guidebook for an efficient water management.</li>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Financial contributions of planning applications to prevention of heathland fires in Dorset, UK]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel Coast. The Dorset heathlands cover an extensive area of South East Dorset, fragmented by urban development and other land uses. These heathlands once covered over 50,000 hectares, stretching as far as Dorchester and Poole. Changes in agricultural practice, conifer planting, scrub encroachment, urban expansion and road building have all contributed to a reduction in area. Dorset's fragmented heaths total approximately 7,000-8,000 hectares today. Heathlands are an important habitat and are protected by European-level designations. They are prone to fires, and this risk is likely to increase with climate change, due to higher temperatures and more frequent dry conditions. Moreover, development nearby protected sites significantly increases the risk of fires and other negative impacts on the heath such as loss of biodiversity. The Dorset Heathland Planning Framework Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) seeks to secure developer contributions toward funding the implementation of a package of alleviation measures to offset the adverse effects of additional residential development on the heathlands, including fire risk. The framework applies to all new housing that results in a net gain in dwelling units within a zone between 400m and 5km of designated European wildlife sites, and no development is permitted within a 400m buffer around heathland sites. This framework can also contribute in reducing heathlands sensitivity to climate change effects.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[development, developer fee, heathland, Dorset, funding scheme, wildfire, protected area]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dorset heathlands are areas of open landscape dominated by low growing dwarf shrubs (mainly Heather family, <em>Ericaceae</em>), and also include areas of acidic grassland, scrub, scattered trees, bog and open water. Heather is highly flammable and climate change poses a real threat in terms of increasing the incidence of heathland fires in Dorset. Climate change scenarios indicate that by 2080, average summer temperatures will have increased by between 1°C and 5°C, and rainfall will have decreased by 20-50%. Warmer and drier summers suggest a potentially significant increase in the number of outdoor fires. For a 1°C increase in future temperatures, a 17-28% increase in the number of outdoor fires in England and Wales is predicted, and for a 2°C increase between 34-56% more fires are predicted to occur annually.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fires are easily started accidentally by poorly extinguished campfires and other causes; deliberate arson is also common. Heaths in the vicinity of urban development tend to catch fire more frequently than in the more rural locations. Around 30% of Dorset heathlands are situated within and around the urban areas, with nearly half a million people living nearby. Moreover, their use for recreation further exposes a large proportion of heathlands to fires and other negative impacts such as trampling or dog disturbance.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Interim Planning Framework – replaced by the SPD in 2012 - developed by a number of local authorities, following the guidance of Natural England, sets out an approach to the mitigation of the harmful effects of residential development on Dorset’s lowland heaths, including increased risk of fire. The approach aims to ensure that the integrity of the heathlands is not further diminished by a steady increase in urban pressures. A range of measures have been identified jointly by the local authorities and Natural England; some of them being also relevant in terms of increased resilience to higher fire risk due to the combined effect of climate change and urban development. The mitigation measures are to be financed by developer contributions coming from new developments located in a distance between 400m and 5km away from the protected heathland. This will help to reconcile the pressures of further residential development with the conservation of the designated heathland sites.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dorset Heathland Planning Framework Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) was adopted in June 2012 and was in place until end of 2014. It replaced the Interim Planning Framework (in place between 2007 and 2012). The SPD document sets out an approach to the alleviation of the harmful effects of residential development on Dorset’s lowland heaths. According to the SPD document, developers who receive planning permission for residential buildings within the zone between 400m and 5km from protected heathland sites pay contribution fees. In general, no additional residential development is permitted within 400m straight distance from protected heathland sites, with the exception of purpose built schemes for the elderly or the disabled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The due obligation is applied to every residential development where there is a net increase in dwellings. The financial contribution is based upon a standard charge, with adjustment for the different occupancy rate for houses and flats. To provide certainty to those making applications for residential development and to ensure transparency and accountability, a mechanism for the calculation of the planning obligation has been adopted, based on the forecast 2-year average population increase by type of dwelling in 2012-2026. The factors that are taken into account for calculating the developers’ contribution consider:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Forecast 2 year average population increase in south east Dorset 2012-2026 = 4871 people;</li>
<li>Local Authority housing trajectory forecasts 2012-2014 = 2934 housing;</li>
<li>Relative proportion of households (houses/flats) = 73% houses; 27% flats;</li>
<li>Projected net population increase per dwelling (persons/dwelling) = houses: 1.81; flats: 1.13;</li>
<li>Cost of the mitigation measures (as of November 2011) = £4.1 million.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Large-scale developments will be expected to explore ways of avoiding or mitigating their adverse impacts through on-site or more likely off site measures to facilitate the implementation of alternative natural greenspace. Recourse to financial payments in line with the SPD should be the fall-back position only after exploration and agreement with Natural England and the relevant local planning authority of potential avoidance or alleviation measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of alleviation divided by the forecast population growth i.e. £4.10 million divided by 4871 gives a charge per person of £842. However, an adjustment to the charge to allow for the net population increase per dwelling type results in a charge per dwelling of a cost per house (£842.00 x 1.81) of £1,524.00  and a cost per flat (£842.00 x 1.13) of £952.00.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These fees are applied to fund a number of measures to mitigate the impact of urban development on heathlands, that can contribute in reducing heathlands sensitivity to climate change induced effects, as in particular to increased fire risk. Mitigation measures include: (i) improvement of existing recreational sites and development of new recreational infrastructure to divert the recreational pressure from the most valuable and sensitive heathlands; (ii) land purchased as alternative open space; (iii) provision of more rangers and wardens; (iv) purchasing monitoring equipment; (v) land management to reduce fire load and risk of fires; and (vi) purchasing firefighting equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2008, the project collected £1.75 million, and a number of alleviation projects have been implemented across South east Dorset. The system of calculating the financial contribution is clear, robust and easy to operate. In addition, the legal basis in nature conservation regulations provides a clear reference point for considering appeals to planning permission decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consultation on the draft updated SPD (2015-2020) commenced on January 2015 and closed on middle February 2015. Representations and changes that are necessary are being considered. It is likely that a revised version will be available during 2015. In this document, an approach to enabling development through the implementation of measures to avoid likely significant effects on the Dorset Heathlands in South East Dorset was set out. Residential development that cannot avoid or mitigate its own adverse effects upon the Dorset Heaths Natura 2000 sites is required to contribute towards the overall Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy. This strategy has two elements, Heathlands Infrastructure Projects (HIPs) that provide facilities to attract people away from protected heathland sites, and Strategic Access Management and Monitoring (SAMM), which is non-infrastructure provision such as wardening, education and monitoring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Borough of Poole is implementing one aspect of the draft SPD ahead of the document as a whole, and this relates to the introduction of a charge for SAMM. Any new dwelling that comes forward by whatever course will pay a direct contribution toward mitigating the adverse effects of its impact upon the Dorset Heaths. The charge will be £355 for a house and £242 for a flat.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The heathlands in urbanised Dorset have a history of protection through partnership approaches. Dorset Heathland Forum was first established in 1989. Then Urban Heaths Partnership was then established with the focus on the conservation and maintenance of heathland located close to human settlements, with a particular focus on management of access. The partnership includes: local authorities, Dorset County Council (partnership leader), Dorset Wildlife Trust, Dorset Fire &#38; Rescue Service, Dorset Police, Natural England (then called English Nature), The Herpetological Conservation Trust, Forestry Commission, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Urban Heaths Partnership successfully applied for £1.2 million funding from the European Union LIFE-Nature fund. The four-year Urban Heaths LIFE Project, launched in July 2001, addressed urban pressures on the heaths by providing extra wardens, new firefighting equipment for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service, a Heathland and Wildlife Protection Officer in Dorset Police and delivering an education programme within the local community and its schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2007, a joint Dorset Heathland Executive Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Interim Planning Framework (in place between 2007 and 2012). This group consists of a Councillor from each of the 6 local authorities (Borough of Poole, Bournemouth Borough Council, Christchurch Borough Council, East Dorset District Council, and Purbeck District Council) together with representatives from Natural England, Home Builders Federation and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The Executive considers schemes recommended by the Heathland Planning Framework Officer Group (HPFOG) to mitigate the impact of additional urban pressures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The SPD document also underwent public consultation. Ninety-six individuals and organisations made 1,001 representations to various parts of the leaflet outlining the SPD. 119 objections were received, 199 representations of support, 96 representations of support with conditions, as well as 595 'observations' and 'other' comments. The geographical area of the SPD, the use of greenspace as an alternative to heathland for users and the tariff system were the themes that gathered the highest amount of comments.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors can be identified in the following points:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>A previously existing partnership was used as a basis for development of the Interim Planning Framework. Also, the participation in the LIFE-Nature project allowed for collection of necessary evidence and development of experience in application of various alleviation measures.</li>
<li>The collaborative approach is preferable to local authorities applying alleviation measures individually. Focus on the entire area where heathland is concentrated, consistency of approach, pooling of developers’ contributions and collective prioritisation of the alleviation projects are the main advantages of the collaborative approach.</li>
<li>Development of statutory policies in the Local Development Frameworks of the planning authorities in the near future will be an additional benefit helping to drive forward the implementation of associated alleviation projects.</li>
<li>The use of Section 106 agreements based on biodiversity protection requirements for developers to contribute to is an innovative funding mechanism for alleviation of urban pressure on heathland across the south east Dorset area.</li>
<li>The measures applied are not only physical. Engagement with the local community is emphasised to increase the awareness of fire danger and other negative impacts on heathland.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">As limiting factor, it was observed by the UK Government that there is a limited potential to protect the heathland by establishment of buffer zones. This is due to the proximity of existing infrastructure to these zones, and the potentially very costly and extensive demolition and relocation programmes that would need to take place.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The measure itself requires only marginal costs for administrative work. The cost of measures to mitigate the impact of urban development on heathland in south east Dorset was estimated at £4.1 million (November 2011 prices) and these should be brought up by the charges on house owners as a result of the measure. The benefits are the assurance that the integrity of the heathlands is not further eroded or diminished by a steady increase in urban pressures due to additional development, the reduced risk of fires, the preservation of the biodiversity, and the contribution to the reduction of heathlands sensitivity to climate change.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dorset heathlands qualify for three European designations:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive;</li>
<li>Candidate Special Areas of Nature Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive.</li>
<li>Ramsar sites (an international designation) by virtue of supporting certain wetland bird habitats and species.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The international nature conservation designations cover 96% of the Dorset heathland, and 97% is covered by the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) UK designation. Following these designations, regulation 48 of the UK Conservation requires that any application for development or strategic plan which is likely to significantly affect a European site is subject to an appropriate assessment of the implications of the proposal for the site’s conservation objectives. The planning authority must ascertain that the plan or project will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site, alone or in combination with other plans or projects, either directly or indirectly, taking account of any conditions or restrictions that would help ensure no adverse effect, before granting permission or adopting a plan or policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage and purpose of converting the IPF to a SPD is that it brings it within the current planning system and it will become part of each of the participating local authorities Local Development Frameworks. SPD is to be delivered on the basis of Section 106 (S106) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which allows a local planning authority to enter into a legally-binding agreement or planning obligation with a landowner in association with the granting of planning permission. The obligation is termed a Section 106 Agreement. These agreements are a way of delivering or addressing matters that are necessary to make a development acceptable in planning terms. They are increasingly used to support the provision of services and infrastructure, such as highways, recreational facilities, education, health and affordable housing.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The SPD was in place until December 2014; the updated SPD will cover the period 2015-2020.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Heat Hotline Parasol – Kassel region]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Demographic change and climate change together place great challenges on the society. The life expectancy of the population in Germany rises and so does the share of older people. Besides chronic patients and children, the elderly are especially affected by the effects of the climate change. At the same time more and more people live in single person households (increase from 14.56 million in 2004 to 16.83 million in 2016 in Germany), which can influence their social isolation. How can we reach these people in order to prevent negative impacts during heatwaves?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the heat hotline parasol from the city of Kassel (around 200.000 inhabitants) in Germany comes into play. The heat hotline parasol is a free of charge hotline that calls registered citizens and provides information on heat-warnings from the German Weather Service and suggest measures how to best deal with and adapt to higher temperatures and heat. With this hotline special support is provided to citizens, especially elderly and their families, to deal with heat in the urban area of the city of Kassel. The Elderly Committee of the City of Kassel and the Health Department of the Kassel region cooperates in the heat hotline parasol.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Heatwaves are defined by persistent daytime and night-time temperatures that exceed certain limits, negatively affecting the health of individuals and at-risk groups. Heat waves occur in recurrent intervals in Germany; due to climate change, more prolonged and more frequent heat waves are to be expected in the country. Under a high emissions scenario, the number of days of warm spell (heatwaves) is projected to increase from about 10 days in 1990 to about 135 days on average in 2100 (<span><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246122/1/WHO-FWC-PHE-EPE-15.19-eng.pdf">WHO, 2015</a></span>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of heat stress, infants, young children, the elderly and sick people are especially affected. For example, longer and more intensive periods of heat exert great stress on the cardiovascular system. Due to the increase in the number of hot days, additional deaths can be expected, especially in urbanised areas. Increased demands might be placed on the health infrastructure during the course of heatwaves.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the experience of the hot summer and heatwaves in 2003, the German Weather Service developed a heat warning system for the Land of Hessen, within which Kassel is located. The objectives were to warn citizens and relevant organisations in early phases before a heatwave strikes and also to be better prepared for the increased frequency and intensity of heat stress and heatwaves in the future due to climate change. The heat hotline parasol supports this effort providing its service to citizen of the city of Kassel to be informed about heat warnings and recommendations for measures to deal with increased heat stress.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The heat hotline parasol has found a simple and effective solution to provide information on heat-warnings: by telephone, deaconess (members of the protestant sisterhood) and members of the elderly committee inform about heat hazard and possible measure to be adopted to reduce the risk. In the framework of KLIMZUG-Nordhessen (climate adaptation network for the Nordhessen region, part of the Hessen Land), the Health Department of the Kassel region and the mother house of the deaconship started the heat hotline parasol in 2010 as a pilot activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the pilot phase, since summer 2011 it has developed into a basic service offer. In the period from 15 June to 31 August members of the elderly committee inform for free about heat warning (starting from warning level 2) issued by the German Weather Service for the city and the region of Kassel. The written application of citizens to the service is taken up by the Health Department of the Kassel region. During an initial telephone conversation the staff of the Health Department offers each user an individual risk assessment. If it turns out that an increased heat-related risk is given, a broad set of further support activities is provided. These include an individual health consultation by telephone or in the users own household as well as a detailed individual risk management consultation within the framework of a preventive home visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The basis for the heat hotline parasol is the heat warning provided by the German Weather Service for the city of Kassel and its region. In response to the hot summer of 2003, the Hessian Ministry of Social Affairs developed in cooperation with the German Weather Service a heat warning system for the state of Hessen (Decree of 22 June 2004, amended on 22 April 2008). Main characteristics of the Hessen heat warning system are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>It is based on the bio meteorological concept of "perceived temperature". In addition to the air temperature parameters such as wind speed, solar radiation and humidity - because of the heat exchange between man and the atmosphere is significantly influenced by their interactions - are included in the calculation of the sensed temperature.</li>
<li>Heat warnings are divided into two alert levels: (i) high thermal load (or high heat load) which is published 48 hours in advance with a sensed temperature above 32°C; (ii) extreme thermal load (or extreme heat load) which is issued 24 hours in advance in case of perceived temperature exceeding 38°C. In addition, the second warning level automatically applies from the fourth consecutive day of the heat warnings.</li>
<li>The measures under strong heat stress (high thermal load) are aimed primarily at people who live in nursing homes. In the case of a heat warning all nursing homes operating in the jurisdiction of the Hessian home supervision are informed by the German Weather Service via e-mail. In case of a heat warning, the nursing homes are required to initiate and document all necessary individualized, preventive emergency measures. The Hessian home supervision checks the quality of the performed nursing interventions randomly.</li>
<li>In case of extreme heat load, the nursing homes must ensure enhanced medical care for their residents, if necessary by including the attending doctors. In addition, the nursing homes at risk of health problems and abnormalities that may be associated with the extreme heat stress are obliged to inform the competent health authority.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The heat hotline parasol informs about these warnings as the next step in the information chain.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As a first step, it was important to find out in which heavily heat-affected areas lots of elderly people live. Especially there, preventive action is required. In cooperation with KLIMZUG-Nordhessen, small-scale climate and demographic data were compared with the structural fabric of the residential areas. The results was the identification of risk areas of the city of Kassel. Examples of measures for adaptation to heat extremes were developed and tested in these areas. To this end, the Network for Heat Prevention was established at the municipal level, in which selected actors worked together in an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2010, partners of this network conducted a district conference. Their goal was to discuss climate change in Northern Hessen and its health effects on the elderly population and to develop strategies for preventive care. About 40 people from the health care sector, municipal elderly care, residential construction, public administration, churches and retailers took part in the conference. The mother house of the deaconship, represented by its superior, put forward the idea of a heat hotline. At the same time, it signalled the willingness to take part in project planning and implementation. Other people participating at the conference – employees from outpatient care services, doctors' offices and pharmacies – were also interested. The idea of the heat hotline parasol was born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, a project group consisting of representatives of KLIMZUG-Nordhessen and the organizations involved was commissioned with the project. Their overall objective was to develop a transparent, uniform and binding approach for all concerned. The working group developed workflows, work aids (documentation sheets, etc.), a training concept for the volunteer callers as well as the related training materials.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The heat hotline started for the first time in summer 2010 as a pilot activity. In the test phase the heat hotline was only offered to one Kassel district with particularly high heat-related risks. Due to the positive experiences and the large public resonance, the heat hotline was offered to all citizens of the city of Kassel in the summer 2011 for the first time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elderly people are affected to a high degree by heat, but are generally cautious about prevention offers. Often this group underestimates own vulnerability against heat-related risks regarding their health. This might represent a limiting factor in the actual implementation of the heat hotline parasol service.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial phase was based on a research project held in 2010. The service itself is free of charge and run by volunteers of the elderly committee and is coordinated by the Health Department of the Kassel region. It is challenging to estimate the staff time working on the hotline regarding the costs and resources associated with running the hotline.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The heat hotline parasol is a volunteer’s activity and a joint collaboration between the elderly committee and the Health Department of Kassel region.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The heat hotline parasol was developed in 2010 and implemented in some districts of Kassel in 2011. Since 2013 it became a service of the Health Department of Kassel region; the service is available for free every summer to the city and the region of Kassel.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Barcelona trees tempering the Mediterranean city climate]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As a Mediterranean coastal city, Barcelona is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Its high population density also magnifies the local heat island effect which causes an array of health and environmental challenges. Climate change projections include a rise in average temperature and a significant decrease in rainfall, with expected lasting droughts and intense heat waves. In response, Barcelona has committed to becoming a global model of a sustainable city combating urban development challenges related to climate change and population density. In this context, Barcelona has been focusing on planting and managing trees for many years and currently is completing the “Trees for living. Barcelona Tree Master Plan 2017-37”, in lines with the goal of the Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020 (BGIBP).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With regard to their climate adaptation benefits, trees modify the urban microclimate and temper the climate conditions by providing cooling through shade and transpiration. In addition, the reflection of sunlight by the leaves lowers the temperature in pedestrian areas and the shade protects people from the sun, especially during the hottest months. Furthermore, trees can prevent possible local flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main climate change challenges for Barcelona are related to rise in temperature, significant decrease in precipitation and increase in related extreme events such as droughts and heat waves. The high urban density can act as a driver exacerbating the heat island effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of a network of trees as a green infrastructure and climate change adaption measures brings a number of challenges that must be taken in consideration for their proper management in particular in climate changed conditions. On the one hand these challenges include: health and safety risks due to pollen, risk of falling trees or branches, tree pests or diseases, and limitation of the space availability for other uses. On the other hand, trees are experiencing water and heat stress during the summer dry season that will be likely aggravated in the future due to expected climate changes. Intense sunlight and high temperatures cause high rates of evapotranspiration and water loss from leaves. This is accentuated by buildings reflecting sunlight and not dissipating energy due to the lack of evaporative surfaces, therefore further heating-up the atmosphere. In addition, the effect of air pollutants emitted by urban activity, mainly vehicle traffic, must also be taken into account. And to make matters worse, trees have a much smaller water reserve because the ground is impermeable (e.g. tarmac, pavements). These environmental conditions, which are far from ideal for trees to grow in, lead to water and heat stress, which is manifested to a certain extent by partial defoliation well before autumn. Leaf loss is a defense mechanism that reduces water loss and thereby prevents dehydration. Windy days favour the massive fall of weakened leaves. This does not signal the coming of autumn, but rather it is quite simply how trees defend themselves in the city. In Barcelona, this phenomenon particularly affects plane trees.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Trees for living. Barcelona Tree Master Plan 2017-37” (hereafter “Tree Master Plan”), currently being drafted, will become the strategic document giving Barcelona City Council guidance for future actions in municipal planning, management and conservation of the arboreal city. With the Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020 (BGIBP) - which is the “umbrella” strategic plan for actions related to green infrastructure and biodiversity - and the Trees Master Plan, the city has the vision to create a well-managed, healthy and biodiverse woodland aiming to: connect to both the urban and natural environment, be resilient and adapted to climate change, provide benefits to urban people and be appreciated for its value. According to the Plan vision trees are considered a fundamental part of the green infrastructure of Barcelona, a natural resource that helps enjoying a healthier life in the city. Trees conserve and increase urban biodiversity, connect people with nature, provide social and environmental services (e.g. related to health, habitability, landscape, etc.) to current population and future generations. The conservation of this green heritage is promoted by the Barcelona City Council with the involvement of everyone, both public and private organizations and citizens.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The management of street trees was already included as an action in the earlier Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020 (BGIBP), which is the “umbrella” strategic plan for actions related to green infrastructure and biodiversity in Barcelona. Besides setting out an action plan, the BGIBP provides for a model of an urban green network and a city where green elements are not ornamental accessories but rather genuine green infrastructures. In the broader context, the BGIBP is a component of the overall efforts the city of Barcelona is making in terms of sustainable development and resilience to climate change. In particular, with the BGIBP Barcelona seeks to enhance the city ecological, environmental, social and economic services by connecting various areas with vegetation to produce effective ecological infrastructure. The aim is to secure a city model where nature and urbanity interact and enhance one another for the benefit of citizens, to enable them to derive welfare from the natural heritage and be actively engaged in the protection and improvement of all areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the relevance of trees a Trees Master Plan is being completed as a separate document remaining in line with the goals of the BGIBP. To have trees being appreciated as a true urban infrastructure of first order and to favour cooperation between the municipal departments 10 strategic lines constitute the basis for the Trees Master Plan. These include: heritage and biodiversity, planning and connectivity, plant material, land, water, safety and pruning, health of trees, preservation and protection, knowledge, and communication and participation. These 10 lines will be displayed by 46 actions and a range of associated tasks that have been prioritised considering mandates and the timing of actions for the coming years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an illustration, some examples are below given on how the challenge of climate change is currently addressed through Barcelona Trees Master Plan’s actions:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Species are selected suited to the environmental conditions and resilient to water and heat stress. Furthermore, the city’s aim is for no one species to exceed 15% of the total of street trees in Barcelona. The reasoning behind this approach, which is being achieved gradually, is to avoid mono-specific populations vulnerable to pests and diseases. The species chosen are more resistant to pests and diseases, the best adapted to the low availability of water and preferably native. When needed, pest control is mainly approached through biological control.</li>
<li>A limiting factor for street trees is that they mostly have very little space in the ground for the roots, with very little organic material and compact soil with little structure and deficient nutrition. In most instances, this is caused by the small width of the pavements and the tree pits. Therefore, in the public area, streets wider than six meters shall be located as they provide scope for transforming individual tree pits into continuous pits. Tree pit conditions shall also be improved in the remaining areas with street trees.</li>
<li>In response to water and heat stress there is an increased use of runoff water in park and forest areas and alternatives to drinking water for tree watering are promoted. Furthermore, plants with low water requirements are selected and for each species of tree the appropriate irrigation is determined according to their biology and where and when they are planted. Automatic irrigation systems are in place for the watering of trees and there is controlling for leaks for these systems.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">While Barcelona has a relatively low ratio of green space per inhabitant, it has more street trees than most other European cities. Currently there are over 200.000 trees of 150 different species lining the streets of Barcelona (approximately 1 tree for every 10 m of street), with new trees being planted every year. When including the trees in parks (about 36.000) and those in forest areas (73.500) all together about 310.000 trees are managed by the City Council.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It is vital for citizens to become engaged in the greening of the city. This is addressed through actions on:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Communication and education; the City Council’s strategy focuses on citizen knowledge of the natural urban environment and its benefits, and respect for green spaces. For example, actions include the development and implementation of a communication strategy on trees, to promote education projects on trees in schools, to encourage public involvement in projects and to make use of new technologies for dissemination such as Apps related to trees.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Participation; the City Council works with sector-based and territorial associations and institutions generally in relation to a specific space or group. For example, when developing the Barcelona Citizen Commitment to Sustainability 2012-22 document, over 800 organisations were involved, including businesses, civic and professional associations, trade unions, foundations, universities, schools and various areas and districts of the local administration.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Cooperation; it includes involvement in the design of green spaces. The formation of these spaces by technical services often derives from participation processes including both residents and the district representatives. Such participation often involves brainstorming and the identification of needs by users which are then reflected in definitive project plans.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The following elements can be highlighted in terms of success and limiting factors:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">To succeed in greening Barcelona it is key to have broad stakeholder participation. Indeed, in order to further advance and bolster local leadership, networks need to be created and institutional relations strengthened with the organisations involved in the conservation of biodiversity and green infrastructure in the city.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation and volunteer actions need to be balanced with the integration of biodiversity goals and green infrastructure objectives in policy and legislation. In particular it is of great value to legally enshrine the linkage between urbanity and nature in urban planning projects and spatial planning.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Trees Master Plan as a single action already provides benefits in terms of adaptation to climate change. However, the impact of this plan is much more far-reaching because it is only one action within a much broader set of actions Barcelona is implementing in greening the city and addressing climate change. Also, the greening of the city has many more benefits than resilience to climate change only, with several ecosystem services that will be increasing in value.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the costs, the estimated budget of the Trees Master Plan is 9.6 million euros/year. Of this budget 8.3 million Euros/year is already available for tree management. The difference of 1.3 million euros/year relates to necessary investments mainly in the areas of improved soil and water management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trees can improve the urban microclimate and temper the climate conditions by providing cooling through shade and transpiration. In addition, the reflection of sunlight by the leaves lowers the temperature in pedestrian areas and the shade protects people from the sun, especially during the hottest months. Furthermore, trees can prevent possible local flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff. Therefore, they can have a relevant role in urban climate change adaptation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trees can also provide a number of co-benefits. In a single year, the trees in Barcelona are able to remove more than 305 tons of air pollutants accounting for an estimated value to society of 1.12 million Euros (numbers are for 2008). Further, the annual storage of carbon in the city’s trees amounts to 113.000 tons. Trees and, more generally, plant cover, further also reduce noise pollution, regulate dampness, balance the water cycle, reduce energy consumption in buildings, create ecological connectivity, and serve as a habitat for more biodiversity. It also affords a more pleasant urban landscape and can serve as a place for socialisation or gatherings, and as a location for taking a stroll or engaging in sports and leisure activities in the open air.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The conservation of biodiversity and the strengthening of green infrastructure have been incorporated into the local political commitments and human and financial resources have been allocated to it. Moreover, work is carried out in a coordinated manner ensuring goals are aligned with other similar municipal local projects and plans, other institutions and bodies affording knowledge, energy and actions with a view to building a future-proof Barcelona. The recently enacted environment bylaw incorporated the concept of biodiversity for the very first time. Also, progress has been made in metropolitan urban planning in taking care of open spaces (Territorial Plan for the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona). For current urban planning projects, preservation criteria and measures have also been incorporated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That trees are essential in a dense compact city like Barcelona is also confirmed by the Barcelona Charter, the “Declaration of the Rights of Trees in the City”, drawn up and signed in Barcelona on the occasion of the first congress of the Spanish Association of Arboriculture. This Charter establishes the rights of trees in the urban environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2001, Barcelona City Council has implemented an environmental management system with UNE-EN-ISO 14001-04 certification in the field of management and maintenance of public green areas and street trees. Additionally, via a list of recommendations and through the application of the Granada Regulations the city provides guidance on how to protect trees during construction work on public roads, while unique specimens are protected by the Catalogue of Trees of Local Interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, it is important to say that according to the city’s environmental legislation all trees are considered part of Barcelona's arboreal heritage, both those in areas of public and of private property. While the City Council is concerned with the management of the municipal property trees, its overall responsibility is to preserve the broader arboreal heritage in order to improve the environmental quality of the city and enrich biodiversity and accompanying ecosystem services.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Berlin Biotope Area Factor – Implementation of guidelines helping to control temperature and runoff]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Berlin inner city, plans for the development of new buildings fall under a regulation requiring a proportion of the area to be left as green space: the Biotope Area Factor (BAF) or BFF (Biotop Flächenfaktor). All potential green areas, such as courtyards, roofs and walls are included in the BAF. The regulation is a part of a larger set of documents relating to landscape planning and design and species protection. It responds to the need to encourage more green space in densely built-up urban areas. Climate change is expected to increase and intensify heat waves and water-related extremes that are of particular relevance for cities. Thus, the BAF is an important mechanism to reduce local vulnerability as its measures help to lower the temperatures and improve the runoff management. The BAF started to be implemented in 1994 and is still on-going. A considerable number of new built areas in the inner centre have implemented this regulation, translating it into green areas.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Berlin climate is temperate, with a significant urban heat island effect which raises the temperature by up to 4ºC relative to surrounding areas. While there is much uncertainty about the precise impacts of climate change on the city, scenarios indicate that temperatures will be higher, extreme weather events like heat waves and intense rain and hailstorms will be more frequent, air pollution will increase, and there will be water shortage (the latter despite extensive sources of freshwater in the city, due to longer, drier periods without precipitation, increased water consumption, and the diversion of water further upstream). These modifications in climate are expected to have negative impacts on the population, especially considering that a high density of construction and great environmental impact characterize Berlin city centre. Land that experiences high use is often severely limited in its function by:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A high degree of soil sealing;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Inadequate replenishment of the groundwater, due to the rapid runoff of rainfall into the sewage system;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Lack of humidity and excess warming;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A constant decrease in biodiversity, due to inadequate green space.</li>
</ul>]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The BAF contributes to the following environmental quality goals:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Safeguarding and improving the microclimate and atmospheric hygiene, reducing the urban heat island effect and therefore reducing vulnerability to heat waves;</li>
<li>Safeguarding and developing soil function and water balance, reducing vulnerability to water-related extremes;</li>
<li>Creating and enhancing the quality of the plant and animal habitat as well as improving the ecosystem's functionality;</li>
<li>Improving the residential environment.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, urban planning implemented to conform with the BAF can play an important role in minimising the consequences of climate change, as it affects phenomena like local heat island effects, flood magnitudes, water quality and availability.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Biotope Area Factor establishes that the development of new buildings requires a proportion of the area to be left as a green space. The BAF provides developers, architects and designers with clear but flexible guidelines on the portion of a plot of land that must be planted or provide other green space functions in terms of: improvement of the microclimate, urban cooling, sustainable drainage, improvement of natural habitats and enhancement of the quality of the residential environment. Specific solutions implemented in the BAF included: (i) greening of functional spaces (e.g. bike or bin sheds); (ii) planting trees and shrubs or, in smaller areas, climbing plants to create green walls; (iii) introducing green roofs; (iv) paving only on main routes and using permeable surfaces elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These measures reduce radiation fluxes, provide shade, provide cooling effect inside buildings and outside, improve air and water quality, and improve storm-water run-off. The strength of the BAF concept is that it allows flexibility of the site design: the developer may decide what green space measures are applied, and where, as long as the required green space ratio is achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The BAF formula calculates the proportion of an area that needs to be green space: BAF = Ecologically Effective Surface Areas/Total Land Area. BAF targets depend on the specific uses of an area. Residential and public areas need to achieve a BAF target of 0.6 while commercial, business and administrative areas are requested to achieve a lower target of 0.30. Different types of green spaces are weighted differently according to their “ecological value”, based on evapotranspiration capacity, permeability, possibility to store rain water, relationship to soil functioning and provision of habitat for plants and animals. For example, the weighting of <em>surfaces with vegetation unconnected to soil below</em> is 0.5; that of <em>surfaces with vegetation connected to soil below</em> is 1.0 and that of <em>green roofs</em> is 0.7. The developers can thus use a wide range of options combining different areas with different types of surfaces for achieving the required standard.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Biotope Area Factor was formulated for inner-city districts of Berlin by a large number of experts who agreed on the necessary proportion of green space areas for different development types, based on the layout of the buildings. Public consultation has always been considered highly important for landscape planning in Germany. The Landscape Programme was extensively consulted on with the public in 1986 in a targeted consultation exercise “Berlin hat Pläne (Berlin has plans)”. The second public consultation for the Programme was held after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1993, with the Plan finally approved in 1994. The BAF was established in landscape plans as an ordinance. As part of the above procedures, public agencies and environmental agencies could participate in its development. In addition it was mandatory that the proceedings would be publicly displayed not only for residents of the particular area but Berlin-wide. Although there was a possibility for stakeholders to participate, they were not directly approached and therefore, stakeholder involvement was diverse depending on the case. Participating stakeholders included the local community, the public administration, and environmental NGOs.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Use of regulations has proven to be an effective means of increasing green cover in Berlin city centre as every new development needs to comply with BAF targets. Flexibility of the approach provides significant advantages. Developers can choose between a number of different options for greening or creating permeable surfaces, and pick those that are the most beneficial and effective for themselves and the users of the development. Collaboration between the Berlin departments of landscape planning and land use planning ensured that the two planning instruments central to the implementation of the BAF are working in a coordinated way. Another factor that clearly contributes to its success is that the measures visibly proportionate the development of a better environment in the inner-city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BAF is compulsory only in areas where legally binding Landscape Plans are present (16% of Berlin in 21 distinct areas). Outside these areas the BAF is voluntary and can be used as a guideline for encouraging environmental  measures to be incorporated when changes to the existing building structures are proposed. While this could significantly limit the applicability of BAF, due to its simplicity and the rising knowledge of environmental issues, architects, builders and property owners tend to use the BAF, which is a sign of its success.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs of the measures selected on the basis of the BAF are diluted within construction costs. They may be calculated or not by each building owner who does not always inform administrative authorities. If building owners are confronted with inappropriate high expenses, they normally ask for an alleviation of the BAF which will be normally agreed to. An overall evaluation of costs has not been carried out due to a shortage of staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Benefits observed so far include an improved residential environment and quality of life and an increase of the effective area for biodiversity through restoring greened inner courtyards and front gardens. Other benefits such as reduced vulnerability to heat waves and to water-related extremes are expected but have not been quantified, yet.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Berlin the BAF can be established primarily in landscape plans as an environmental planning parameter. BAF is applied to areas where legally binding Landscape Plans are present. The inherent legally-binding arrangements can be found in Berlin's "Handbuch der Berliner Landschaftspläne". Outside these areas the BAF is voluntary and can be used as a guideline for encouraging environmental measures to be incorporated when changes to the existing building structures are proposed.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Catchment management approach to flash flood risks in Glasgow]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Normally a shallow river, the White Cart Water was prone to flash flooding. Its water levels can rise by six metres after just 12 hours of rain, which threatened vulnerable Glasgow suburbs downstream. Public awareness of such flooding risks in the 1980s and 1990s, and projections of more intense periods of rainfall made devising a flood prevention scheme a priority for the Glasgow City Council. In 2006, the scheme for the White Cart Water and its tributary (the Auldhouse Burn) promoted by the city council in 2004 was approved by the Scottish Government and became Scotland’s largest flood prevention scheme at that time. It includes the construction of three upstream water storage areas outside of the city and a suite of downstream measures within the urban area such as low walls and embankments. Future climate change risks were taken into account and the flexibility of the design of the upper catchment storage areas allows other storage areas to be introduced to redress the balance caused by the effects of climate change in due course.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The White Cart Water has inflicted misery to residents and businesses in the south side of Glasgow over many decades. The river is prone to flash flooding. As little as twelve hours of rain can cause water levels to rise by six metres with the potential to turn the river into a raging torrent as it gathers momentum downstream towards the vulnerable suburbs of the city. In the last 100 years there have been more than 20 significant floods caused by relatively minor storms. One of the most memorable was at Hogmanay in 1984 when 500 homes were inundated and millions of pounds of damage caused. Only 12 days later floods inflicted further misery in the same area. In 1990 residents in the area were struck again. In 1994, the river burst its banks once more in various places, and in 1999 families suffered thousands of pounds of damage when the water reached waist height in their homes. Altogether it was estimated that 1,710 residential buildings and 40 businesses are at risk of flooding, although due to the tenemental character of the housing in this area this equates to more than 6,700 homes, with the estimated damage costs being greater than £100 million, at 2008 values, if nothing is done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Existing flood defences along the White Cart Water corridor were piecemeal and isolated. Major investment was required to protect properties not only from current flood risks but also from more frequent inundations expected as a result of global climate change Based on UKCP09 projections, medium emissions scenario and a 2050’s time horizon for Glasgow, there will be an increase in severity of fluvial flooding events (1:100 year event increase to 1:200 year event) and increase in severity of pluvial flooding events (from 1:100 annual to 1:200 annual).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The threat of repeated flooding also presented major insurance difficulties for householders, businesses and the local economy. At the end of 2002 the insurance industry withdrew its guarantee of affordable flood insurance in high-risk areas. The industry confirmed it would have to consider charging higher insurance premiums or even refusing flood cover altogether. This could result in property values being greatly reduced.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Public awareness of the 1980s and 1990s floods, coupled with increasing awareness that meteorologists project more intense periods of rainfall in future as a result of climate change, made finding the solution for a scheme a major priority for Glasgow City Council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The general effect of the scheme was to mitigate the flooding of residential and business properties in several areas of suburban Glasgow by the White Cart Water and two areas of suburban Glasgow by the Auldhouse Burn (White Cart Water tributary). The scheme also included the construction of flood attenuation areas upstream of Glasgow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme was designed to guard against the 1% (one in 100 years) flood event taking into account climate change projections by 2050s, which equates to 0,5% (one in 200 year) flood event based on current situation (data from year 2006); as well as to provide a sustainable, environmentally friendly solution to the flooding problem.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of studies were carried out since 1984 to determine a suitable flood prevention scheme for the White Cart Water and its tributary to provide protection up to the 1 in 200 year event (corresponding to protection up to 1 in 100 years event by 2050s, according to considered climate change projections). In 2002 the development of the scheme began with the help of consulting engineers. The resulting White Cart Water Flood Prevention scheme, the largest flood protection scheme in Scotland, was published in November 2004 and approved by the Scottish Government in 2006.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme is based on the catchment management principle. It combines cutting-edge engineering solutions and natural flood risk management techniques. Central to this is the optimisation of flood water storage in the upper catchment, allowing flood defence walls within the city to be limited to an acceptable height, helping to limit the impact on existing wildlife habitats and avoid creating barriers between the river and the community. The alternative approach would be a 'walls only' solution, which would have resulted in the construction of unacceptably high walls along the urban corridor of the river.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan involved the construction of three flood storage areas upstream the city to temporarily hold back the bulk of floodwater generated by extreme rainfall, and control the release of water passing downstream through the city to an acceptable level. In all, 33 sites were considered for the construction of the storage reservoirs with dams up to sixteen metres in height; these sites were evaluated for size, topography, geotechnical suitability and the associated environmental impacts. Several of the sites considered were discarded due to significant environmental and geotechnical concerns. Together the three finally constructed flood storage areas have the capability to hold back over 2.6 million cubic metres of flood water and reduce peak river flows by up to 45%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Central to the successful operation of the storage areas was the installation of the world’s largest Hydro-Brake flow control devices into the three dams at each storage area. The Hydro-Brake is designed to enable water to flow unrestricted through it for as long as possible. When the water upstream reaches a pre-determined height in a flood situation, the Hydro-Brake activates and releases water into the river at a controlled rate. The storage sites remain dry for most of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the storm, the temporary storage areas significantly reduce the flow downstream. Nevertheless, this much-reduced flow, combined with the large catchment area downstream of the flood storage areas still pose a threat and be capable of causing flooding in Glasgow. For this reason, flood defences, in the form of low walls and embankments, were also constructed in selected parts of the river corridor through the city of the total length of 7.6km.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These works also gave opportunities for environmental enhancement along the river corridor and around the storage sites. The central concrete culverts, which contain the Hydro-Brakes, were encapsulated by large earth dams, which were constructed mainly using site-won material, which significantly limited the need for heavy lorry journeys to transport 180,000 cubic metres of material. Rather than leave the concrete structures of the spillways for these reservoirs exposed, as they are unlikely to be used, they were in-filled with sacrificial material (soil). Grass cover was established to ensure the dams blend with the existing landscape. These spillways would only be deployed if 1:200 year flooding event happened, in which case the force of released water would flush it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dams and culverts have been designed to ensure they do not prevent the movement of fish and mammals upstream and downstream. The base of the culverts incorporates baffles and boulders to ensure a varied flow pattern and to retain a minimum depth of water for fish passage in low flows. In addition, there are no hydraulic drops, with the base of the culvert laid at the same gradient as the original river bed. Mammal ledges have also been provided throughout the length of the culvert and ongoing monitoring has shown these are being used by otters at all three sites. Moreover, the flood storage areas were seen as an opportunity to enhance biodiversity through the creation of artificial wildlife habitats: woodland with 6,000 newly planted trees, scrub, and over 90,000 square metres of species-rich wet grasslands, shallow scrapes and ponds. Similarly, within the city re-development of an existing park, embellishment of gardens and allotments was undertaken. Also, artificial habitats for birds, bats and otters were created and 1,000 trees were planted. The developments likewise contributed to the improvement of green recreational spaces.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Glasgow City Council recognised the importance of involving the main stakeholders in progressing the scheme. A Steering Group and working groups were established to help develop the scheme, allowing local authorities in the upper catchment and environmental agencies to have input to the scheme from the early stages through to its final form. This proved to be a vital factor ensuring that planning and environmental constraints were identified at an early stage. It also ensured that opportunities for environmental, development and recreational benefits were considered, as well as mitigation of climate change was built into the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of engineering designs for the scheme were complemented by the creation of an Environmental Working Group (EWG) comprising stakeholders from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, Scottish Water, local angling/fisheries groups and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as well as environmental professionals from the three local authorities involved (Glasgow City Council, East Renfrewshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council). The work of the EWG helped to minimise the environmental impact of the scheme, and, where possible, to enhance the natural environment, thus assisting in developing a sustainable flood prevention scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consultation was a key aspect of the scheme development and the selection of the final three flood storage areas. Through one-to-one discussions and an extensive public exhibition, the views and opinions of affected parties were gathered and, where possible, incorporated within the design. The public were kept fully informed about the development and progress of the project through the distribution of regular newsletters and the creation of a dedicated website. Despite the size and scope of the project, only limited objections were received, all of which were subsequently resolved through discussion without the need for a Public Local Inquiry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The detailed stakeholder engagement process ran for a little over two years prior to the submission of the Scheme and was continued to a lesser extent during the time the Scheme was under consideration by the Scottish Ministers which was another eighteen months.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A full-time liaison officer was appointed early in the project to manage stakeholder involvement and remained involved through to the completion of the construction works; this led to a very low number of objections raised by stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooperation and collaboration between surrounding local authorities and the project team was critical to ensuring the smooth passage of the project through the statutory approval processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The presence of many underground services, the close proximity of existing buildings, invasive species (including Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed) and limited access made the design and subsequent construction of the urban flood defences a significant challenge. The form of construction adopted considered these and other constraints and sought to achieve the most appropriate solution. In many areas, the only access to construct the flood defences was from the river stream. Where this was required temporary rock haul roads and working platforms were constructed in within the river.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The construction works were carried out in two separate contracts between 2008 and 2011 with the total contracts value amounting to £53 million (EUR 63 million). The flood defences on the White Cart Water at Cathcart were backed by an 80 per cent grant of £40 million from the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government had a scheme in place where they would provide funding equivalent to 80% of capital flood risk management works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The predicted risk of flooding was estimated to be reduced to less than 1% (including future climate change effects at 2050s), which equates to less than 0.5% risk based on current situation. The installed flood protection measures proved to be effective in averting millions of flood damage early on – even before and right after the completion of works. On 4 February 2011, a one in ten year flood event (10% annual exceedance probability) was significantly reduced in impact, principally as a result of the flood storage areas being hydraulically complete, and it is estimated that between £1 million and £3 million of damage was averted. On 29 November 2011, an even larger flood event occurred. This event occurred shortly after completion of the scheme and some 231 properties avoided flooding, corresponding to a saved cost of £12 million. Post-event analysis has shown the scheme to be performing as expected with model predictions closely matching observed data.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The key legal instrument is the “scheme” itself which was promoted under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961. This gave the Council the right to access property to undertake the works defined by the scheme within certain defined dimensional limits. While the scheme provided the legal framework, to undertake the works all other requirements regarding planning and environmental legislation had to be met and all specific permissions, licences and/or authorisations needed to carry out the works had to be obtained. As the watercourses provide the boundary between different local authorities, a total of 14 separate planning applications had to be made. Two of the dam structures were bisected by the boundary between local authorities and required one part of the dam to be covered by a planning application made in one local authority and the other part in another. These had to be carefully managed and co-ordinated. Moreover, the legislation surrounding the management of the dams required the legal responsibility for a dam split by a boundary to be held by one local authority. Co-operation between the involved local authorities made this possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The collaborative nature of the process between all the involved local authorities and other stakeholders enabled to address issues before they became potential legal hurdles that could have stopped the process or resulted in a Public Local Inquiry or being called for scrutiny by the Scottish Government Ministers. This was key to the successful delivery of the project.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The flood prevention scheme was promoted by Glasgow City Council in 2004 and approved by the Scottish Government in 2006. Construction of the upper catchment flood storage areas and the urban defences was carried out in two separate contracts, which ran concurrently, between 2008 and 2011. The works were completed in 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An additional 3 km of urban defence wall will be constructed by summer 2019, under the Clyde and Loch Lomond local Flood Risk Management Plan. This will further improve flood defences, protecting other areas in the city region.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Improved resilience of biomass fuel supply chain in UK]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Nine UK electricity generating companies have been receiving support based on the provisions of the Climate Change Act of 2008. Specifically, the Joint Environmental Programme (an initiative funded by nine of the leading energy producers in the UK) supports a programme of research focusing on the environmental impacts of these nine leading producers, including Drax Power. The operating subsidiary of the Drax Group plc, Drax Power Limited has 6 boilers with a maximum capacity of 3,945 MW, 3 of which are powered by biomass pellets. This step towards biomass was stimulated by the 2008 Climate Change Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 emission levels) by 2050. The burning of wood pellets has been questioned in regards to the carbon emissions compared to those of coal, yet the sourcing of sustainable wood can alleviate this issue. Drax sources all wood pellets from sustainable, working forests to minimise net carbon releases to the atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maintain a reliable stream of biomass, Drax relies on the maritime transportation of wood pellets from North America, where bulk orders can be sourced. The UK has experienced several storm surges and coastal flooding in recent years, and these events are expected to become more frequent and stronger under future climate change. Therefore, terminal designs at Immingham have been adapted to avoid localised flooding events. Furthermore, Drax has implemented a multi-port strategy in order to alleviate the threat of supply chain backlog if the primary harbour is temporarily inoperable due to a weather-related event or other causes. This has resulted in the implementation of additional biomass terminals at the Ports of Tyne, Hull and Liverpool.</p>

    <field_sectors><![CDATA[Coastal areas]]></field_sectors>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The potential impacts of climate change include more frequent and intense storms, which in combination with flooding and sea level rise, combine to create storm surges. According to the UK Climate Projections 2009 medium scenario projection (UKCP09), sea levels along the UK coast are expected to rise by as much as 0.75 m in the next 100 years, along with a projected increase in coastal flooding and storm surge events. The impacts of such events on energy infrastructure are significant. They include damage caused to supply lines, such as port infrastructure, and impacts to coastal or river-based power stations themselves. For example, Immingham port lost power in significant areas during a storm surge events of 2013 due to localised flooding in sub-stations.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objectives of adapting infrastructure at Drax Power and at associated terminals are to ensure resilience to storm surge impacts in the long term, thereby ensuring that Drax Power is able to supply power securely. Furthermore, the multi-port strategy not only alleviated threats of supply chain backlog in weather-related events, but it also greatly increased the import capacity for biomass supply.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Drax Power has implemented numerous adaptation measures to combat the impacts of storm surge and flooding events on its operations. These include structurally raising power plant equipment above potential storm surge water levels as well as constructing sea walls for protection at their Immingham terminal. Furthermore, subterranean tunnels have been fitted with storm surge barriers, while future tunnel constructions will take place above ground level. At Immingham, the outer lock gate has been upgraded to withstand 1 in 1,000 year flood events, with previous gates able to withstand 1 in 20 year tidal flooding events (under UKCP09 medium emission scenario). Such improvements to flood defences were made through joint investments by Associated British Ports (the owner and operator of The Port of Immingham) and Drax Power. Similar measures have been implemented at the Port of Liverpool and the Port of Hull, where the investments were underwritten by the port themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To further adapt to flood-related impacts, the transportation of biomass pellets from all ports to power plants takes place by diesel-powered trains, avoiding any need for cables which can also be damaged during storms. Finally, Drax has also adopted a geographically-based adaptation strategy to avoid the impacts of localised storm surges through a multi-port strategy. The strategy has seen biomass port terminals dispersed throughout the UK, with terminals fitted with biomass handling equipment at the Ports of Tyne, Liverpool, Hull and Immingham.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Drax Power provides input to Energy UK (a UK trade association for industry) in regards to identifying threats and adaptation measures to climate change. Through such engagement, the energy industry will assist the UK government to understand the level of capacity to adapt within the energy system, which is subsequently fed into UK Climate Change Risk Assessment reports and National Adaptation Programmes. The engagement with Energy UK allows the energy industry to collaborate with each other, to minimise the threats of climate change and improve the resilience of the energy system as a whole. Furthermore, Drax organises stakeholder and NGO roundtables. Two such events were held in London and Brussels in 2017, to discuss approaches to biomass sustainability and the risks associated with wood fibre procurement. However, specific discussions on adaptation needs were not handled.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The geographic spread of ports and flood management measures in ports has allowed Drax to increase its import capacity from the US for wood pellet biomass up to 2 million tonnes per year. There is some controversy regarding the climate benefits as well as biodiversity impacts of the fuel change from fossil fuels to biomass at Drax power plants. Drax is committed to sourcing wood (predominantly harvesting residues and low-value roundwood) from working forests rather than primary forests, and to ensure that the environmental benefits of such forests are maintained (through, for example, tree planting). However, the use of predominantly US forest biomass has attracted some criticism from non-governmental organisations in the US who believe that increased biofuel demand in general, and the increased demand for wood pellets from Drax in particular, is responsible for damage to forest habitats and may even increase GHG emissions. The EEA is not able to take a position in this complex debate, which involves government agencies, non-governmental organisations, certification service providers as well as further experts and stakeholders. The adaptation benefits of this project are not controversial, and they seem transferable to other regions and projects. However, the debate about the wider sustainability aspects of Drax’s biomass strategy stresses that there can be synergies as well as trade-offs between climate change adaptation, mitigation and other environmental and social concerns. The development of adaptation strategies by public and private actors needs to consider those concerns comprehensively in order to avoid maladaptation.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The geographical splitting of biomass supply between multiple ports on both the East and West coasts of the UK reduces the risk of climate events on an interrupted fuel supply. The strategy also allows larger biomass fuel imports to take place, permitting further conversion of the Drax power plant from coal to biomass. Drax can now receive shipments from ships with 65,000 tonne capacities due to investments made by the ports underwritten by long-term contracts with Drax. For example, Drax has invested £135m (€150m) at Immingham to facilitate efficient transport of biomass from the US. The Port of Immingham has invested £4.7 million in the construction of a new outer dock gate to protect against 1 in 1000 year flooding events, and £0.5 million in flood resilience works to electrical substations. Furthermore, when Drax reaches maximum capacity with the projected conversion of a fourth power plant later this year, they find themselves in the unique position of being able to assist other biofuel operators with biomass stocks in times of need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A storm surge in 2013 caused a loss of biomass deliveries to the Drax power plant. As a results, coal was used in order to continue generating power. By now, all of Drax’s boilers run exclusively on 100% biomass. Therefore, assuring a continued biomass supply and preventing damage to biomass stocks from flooding is imperative to their business. If a flooding event such as in 2013 happened today, without adaptation measures, the expected costs to Drax due to loss of operations would be £1 million/day. If the fuel shortage were to lead to power cuts, the wider societal costs would be much higher.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the UK Climate Change Act of 2008, the energy sector is responsible for assessing the risks posed to the sector from climate change. Under the Act, Drax must (along with various other energy system stakeholders) submit Climate Change Adaptation Reports, which explain the climate change risks to their business as well as the response strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the UK Renewables Obligation Scheme, introduced in 2002, electricity suppliers must source a proportion of electricity from renewable sources. Renewable Obligation Certificates are awarded to suppliers who generate renewable electricity, with operators able to trade such certificates with other parties. When suppliers do not have a sufficient number of certificates to meet their obligation within the reporting year, they must then pay a sum into a buy-out fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drax is also party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with a government owned entity (The Low Carbon Contracts Company), which is responsible for delivering aspects for the government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Through this programme, Drax can make or receive payments through the amount of electricity dispatched from their biomass units.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Adapting overhead lines in response to increasing temperatures in UK]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Several energy transmission and distribution companies in the UK have begun to take the impact of increasing temperatures into consideration for the long-design of electricity distribution infrastructure. Rising temperatures can impact power lines by reducing their thermal rating (i.e. the maximum current allowed at a given temperature) and causing lines to sag to dangerous levels. By increasing the rated design temperature standard of overhead lines to accommodate projected temperature rises, transmission system operators can adapt to the increasing ambient temperatures experienced and projected throughout Europe.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[electricity distribution, line sagging, De-rating, power lines]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The frequency of extreme heatwaves in the UK is expected to increase in the future. The UK Climate Projections 2009 project that summer temperatures will increase by up to 4°C in parts of the UK under a medium emissions scenario by 2080. Such ambient temperature increases pose a threat to transmission and distribution operators due to the thermal expansion of power lines when they are heated. Such thermal expansion can cause lines to sag, meaning their clearance from land can become a danger to the general public. Sagging may also result in contact with trees and other structures, which could result in electrocution or fires. Most European countries, including the UK, have legislation in place to maintain a minimum distance between power lines and the ground or structures, in order to ensure that potential instances of electrocution or fires are avoided. Higher ambient temperatures means that the electrical current that passes through overhead power lines must be reduced to prevent the overheating of equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, warmer power lines can result in decreased efficiency due to a process known as de-rating. UK power utilities have assessed that increasing temperatures under climate change could cause carrying capacity to decrease by 4-9% by the mid-21<sup>st</sup> century. All of these impacts ultimately result in risks of accidents, power cuts and revenue losses, as well as cascading network failures. These impacts are compounded by increasing electricity demand during heat episodes, for example due to air conditioning.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">UK transmission and distribution networks have set out to review and update overhead line ratings throughout their whole network. This entails establishing the operational maximum temperature which overhead lines may be subjected under climate change scenarios, and determining a design standard to accommodate the projected increases in line sagging. These adaptation measures increase energy security and reduce risks of electrocution and fire.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Western Power Distribution (WPD) are delivering electricity to 8 million customers throughout a 55,500 km<sup>2</sup> service area in the UK. WPD have benefited from a study led by the UK Met Office (the national weather service). The study ‘Energy Project 2 Climate Change Impacts on the U.K. Energy Industry Project’ utilised energy-sector expertise to identify climate change impacts on energy generation, distribution, transmission and demand. WPD cooperated with the Energy Network Association (ENA) (a trade body organisation funded by transmission and distribution licence holders) in order to operationalise adaptation measures based on the study and to make plans to combat power line de-rating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures identified included increasing the height of poles supporting power lines, installing conductors with hotter operating limits or implementing the use of ‘low-sag’ conductors. WPD assessed that the increased exposure to higher temperatures under projected climate changes would result in a reduced allowable current with their current design standards of wood poles. This would result in efficiency losses, and potentially economic losses, for the operator. The most cost-effective measure identified was to increase the minimum design temperature of new overhead line routes, the achievement of which would typically increase the design height of wood poles by 0.5 metres. This increased height could accommodate the projected increases in sagging without exceeding legal limits on the height of overhead lines. Furthermore, WPD have, in partnership with other UK DNOs, recently completed a project to update the UK Distribution Industry’s understanding of conductor ratings for overhead lines. Through their cooperation with ENA, WPD will be implementing the findings as an update to national standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of this ongoing process, WPD and various other UK energy companies are also developing a software tool that will allow UK energy companies to optimise their overhead line ratings.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The process of identifying adaptation measures was coordinated through work with The Energy Network Association (ENA), with the designated Climate Change Adaptation Task Group facilitating discussions amongst government, regulating agencies and members of network operators. Through such stakeholder engagement, Western Power Distribution is pro-actively reviewing adaptation plans and subsequent measures.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Detailed climate change impacts on the energy system were identified through a collaboration with multiple stakeholders in the context of the ‘EP2 Climate Change Impacts on the U.K. Energy Industry’ project (lead by the Met Office). Such collaborations with weather information services can enable rapid provision of data sets that are directly relevant for decision-makers in the energy sector. The identification of likely climate change impacts on the energy system in advance allows time to implement measures to increase the resilience of the system. In addition, through engaging with the ENA, members of electricity network operators are brought together on the ENA-led Climate Change Adaptation Task Group with government and regulating agencies. The Task Group produces approaches to identify impacts of climate change on electricity TSO and DSO networks, and develop measures to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Such exchanges of information can form an integral component of selecting cost-effective and efficient adaptation measures that can benefit both private actors and the public realms.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Adaptation of French standards for design, maintenance and operation of transport infrastructures]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">At the request of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (DGITM), the Cerema under supervision of the French Administration, completed in 2015 a systematic review of standards and guidelines on the design, maintenance and operation of transport infrastructures. The aim of this review is to adapt transport infrastructures and systems to future climate conditions and foster greater resilience to the effects of extreme weather events. The screening process is being followed by the actual revision and update of the standards, in order to cope with the foreseen changes in climate by 2100; the new standards will replace the existing ones for the design, maintenance and operation of transport infrastructure. The final purpose of the process is to make sure that transport infrastructure, with a long time span of service (sometimes of 100 years or more) can satisfactorily cope with the conditions imposed by future climate and extreme weather events.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Some significant changes in the French climate by 2100 were identified in the climate studies conducted in 2011 and 2012, in the framework of the preparation of the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan. Those with a potential impact on transport infrastructure include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Temperature: increase in average temperature (+3,5 °C in one century under the "pessimist" scenario), decrease in the number of frozen days, and changes in daily temperature variations.</li>
<li>Rain: precipitation tends to decrease in spring and summer; reduction in the number of snowy and rainy days.</li>
<li>Water: surface water with increased flows in winter and more severe low flows in summer (these trends are likely to vary according to watersheds); annual average groundwater levels would tend to decrease, although seasonal fluctuations are still unclear.</li>
<li>Wind: high uncertainty on the expected changes, as there are many differences in the results provided by the models.</li>
<li>Sea level: projections are uncertain, especially at local level, but overall trend to a sea level rise; the hypothesis of sea level rise of 1 m by 2100 is retained for this revision process.</li>
<li>Wave regime: little documentation is available on its future evolution.</li>
<li>Extreme weather events: extremes would tend to increase in frequency and intensity; extreme rainfall associated with these events would decrease in frequency but increase in intensity. Results from modelling of extreme weather events like hurricanes or storms are still very uncertain.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">These changes in climate pose specific challenges to transport infrastructure, which will be addressed through an update of the relevant standards. The update process is however challenging for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Difficulties to identify how changes in climate can influence the climate-related variables traditionally used in transport standards and guidelines.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">High need of communication on the necessity to anticipate climate change impacts and to adapt infrastructures to long term changes.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Huge number of transport standards and guidelines; there is the need to establish a sound priority in their revision and to provide common guidance for it.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Need to establish synergies, with on-going regular technical updates of transport standards and guidelines, and climate projections.</li>
</ul>]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objectives of the systematic review of standards are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Adapt technical requirements of transport infrastructure to expected changes in climate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide an unbiased review and identification of revision needs and priorities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Address transport infrastructure resilience in a comprehensive way, including design, maintenance and operations.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Update climate parameters and indicators commonly used in transport standards, to take account of potential changes in French climate.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The review has been carried out by a technical working group set up by the DGITM involving experts of different transport infrastructures and systems: roads, bridges, earthworks, cableway, railway, aeronautic, waterway, maritime and port sectors. After summarizing major climate trends at short and long term, the working group screened existing French standards, in order to identify those that include references to key climate concepts (such as "temperature", "flood", "rain", "wind"...) that could change in future. The screening, based on databases and expert opinions, mostly focused on technical documents; some regulatory and normative documents have also been taken into consideration. The selected standards were subsequently classified into three groups, in accordance with the needs for revision from a climate change adaptation perspective: (1) those with no need for revision; (2) those in need of revision, and (3) those needing more precise information of the climatic variables and indicators involved for assessing their revision needs. For the third group of standards, the existing information is not sufficient to assess whether there is a need to adapt them to future changes in climate, and further studies will be needed in future. Some examples of standards in each category follow:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Standards with no need for revision: road traffic noise, road landscape design, road drainage guidelines, recommendations for structural design (limit states) in aquatic sites.</li>
<li>Standards needing revision: road pavement design, estimate of general actions for aquatic structures (snow, wind, etc.).</li>
<li>Standards needing further clarifications of the climate parameters: design and construction of new roads, maintenance of urban roads, draining road pavements, guidance on road embankments, principles to laying of long welded rails.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Some hundreds of technical standards (more than 800 only for roads) have been revised. For those needing a more precise understanding of climate parameters involved (category (3) above), the transport experts have provided a list of the precisions required. These refer to the timing (when certain climate changes are likely to happen) and areas affected, or to the precise effects of those changes on some of the parameters used for infrastructure design (frequency of occurrence, intensity, number of days above certain levels, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the revision of standards within category (2) is already being undertaken, the revision of standards under category (3) can only proceed once the necessary clarifications have been provided by climate and meteorological experts. The revised standards will be adopted following the general procedure, including the participation of all relevant stakeholders, and subsequently implemented.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The review has been undertaken in coordination with the DGITM (Directorate General for Infrastructure, Transport and Sea) by the different technical services of the French government: CEREMA (Centre d’Études et d’Expertise sur les Risques, l’Environnement, la Mobilité et l’Aménagement), CETU (Centre d’Études Techniques des Tunnels), STAC (Service Technique de l’Aviation Civile), STRMTG (Service Technique des Remontées Mécaniques et des Transports Guidés), and from the various public transport managers: RFF and SNCF (rail), VNF (inland waterways), and from IFRECOR (Initiative Française pour les Récifs Coralliens). Experts and researchers will be mobilized to calculate climate projections and to adapt the standards. The working group is also currently involved in the AFNOR’s coordination group “Climate Change”.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This action provides an innovative approach to transport infrastructure adaptation as it tries to undertake a homogeneous methodology to review standards to be applied (in a climate change adaptation perspective) to different transport modes and to different phases, as design, maintenance and operations. Other success factors are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Partnership with climatic experts and meteorological services. Climate and meteorological expertise is crucial to define future climate conditions and to understand their consequences for the various elements of transport infrastructure. Efficient partnership is based on a fruitful dialogue, with climate experts understanding the information needs of transport infrastructure designers and managers, and transport specialists adapting their practices to the climate information actually available and its related uncertainty.</li>
<li>Mobilization of in-house technical knowledge within the national administration, overcoming technical fields.</li>
<li>Pragmatic approach, aiming at establishing clear priorities in the revision process, and to achieve quick results for the selected priorities.</li>
<li>Transparency, allowing all interested parties to get access to the information produced by the working group and to the recommendations made.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Limiting factors include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Heterogeneity in the contents and approach of existing standards within the different transport modes.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A few standards databases. Difficulties to identify all standards with climate-related variables: an absolute necessity to consult a high number of transport experts to list and review the standards.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">High specialization in technical expertise, making it difficult to undertake common approaches that cross the traditional borders among "knowledge communities".</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Standards for design, maintenance and operation are based on specific values of climate-related variables, whereas climate projections are often given as ranges of values.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation to long term climate change is often considered as a non-priority issue.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Information on detailed costs is not available; however, as the activities have been carried out by the technical services of the French government, the process has not required significant additional resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Main benefits are expected to be related to long-term savings in operating and maintenance costs of transport infrastructure. The new standards will replace the existing ones for the design, maintenance and operation of transport infrastructure. The final purpose of the process is to make sure that transport infrastructure, with a long time span of service (sometimes of 100 years or more), can satisfactorily cope with the conditions imposed by future climate and extreme weather events.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Replacing overhead lines with underground cables in Finland]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This case study considers a Finnish example of replacing overhead lines with underground cabling. The same strategy is also applied in other European countries. Elenia is the second largest electricity distribution system operator in Finland. To adhere to the outage requirements of Finland’s updated Electricity Market Act, distribution system operators such as Elenia are investing substantially in underground cabling. This is in line with expected impacts of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of precipitation events (in particular storms and snow loads) as well as increased growth and age of trees relating to increasing temperatures, resulting in higher amounts of deadwood. Temperature increase due to climate change is expected to cause deciduous trees to remain in leaf longer, increasing the risk of falling trees and resultant damage to power lines. In many cases, underground cabling efforts have been aligned with the installation of fibre-optic cables by telecommunications companies, in so-called “co-construction” efforts for cost-minimisation. Elenia itself has a target to achieve 75% underground cabling of its network by 2028. Underground cabling contributes to climate change adaptation of the energy system, resulting in secure energy supply.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The collapse of power cables causes temporary loss of power to users, while generating additional reparation costs for power providers. In Finland, both storms and precipitation are expected to increase in line with climate change (<a href="http://www.geophysica.fi/pdf/geophysica_2016_51_1-2_017_ruosteenoja.pdf">Ruosteenoja et al., 2016</a>). Snow precipitation can accumulate on overhead lines causing damage, breakage and power outages. Whether through direct impact or indirect impact (e.g. through tree fall), storms can also cause damage to power lines, resulting in power outages. Furthermore, storms can often increase the rate of lightning flashes, a further cause of power outages through damage to power lines. Tree fall, caused by several factors including strong winds, water accumulation in the soil (which results in easier uprooting), snow accumulation or lighting, can have the same result. Climate change is also predicted to result in deciduous trees remaining in leaf for longer periods, increasing the risk of storm related damages. Nevertheless, the extent to which precipitation and wind storms cause tree fall depends on the age and girth of the trees in question.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to adhere to the outage requirements of Finland’s Electricity Market Act, and to adapt to increasingly frequent and extreme weather events, distribution system operators such as Elenia are investing substantially in underground cabling. Since 2009, Elenia has focused on developing only weather-proofed distribution lines, including underground cabling. The weather-proofing efforts aim to improve security of supply and to promote local employment for underground cabling work for the period in question. Currently, 41% of the company’s cabling is underground, with a 75 % target for 2028.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Underground cabling is viewed as a technique of adapting electricity transmission and distribution systems to climate change since it protects assets from expected climate change impacts including storms and excessive snow loads. The installation of underground cabling involves three predominant techniques: placing cabling in concrete-reinforced troughs, placing the cables in underground tunnels, or directly burying the cables. In Finland, the technique used involves the construction of trenches ranging from around 0.45m to 1m depth, with the cabling then buried within the soil layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By placing cabling underground, most of the adverse weather conditions that traditional transmission infrastructures are exposed to aboveground can be avoided. This refers largely to precipitation and windstorms, which can cause damage to overhead power lines either directly or indirectly through treefall, resulting in power outages. Underground cabling can alleviate the requirement for further and more frequent investments in transmission infrastructure maintenance and repairs. The expected benefits include a more secure energy supply with less instances of weather-related power outages, while also achieving cost savings in the long run due to reduced maintenance and repairs.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Elenia representatives suggested that the construction of weatherproof networks was a long-term process requiring openness and interaction both for the operational purposes and to create trust towards this long-term change. As a result, interaction with key stakeholders at various levels and in particular municipalities is embedded in Elenia’s operations. This interaction generally occurs in a collaborative atmosphere. As an example, in December 2016, Elenia carried out a popular event for local residents in Ruovesi concerning the cabling project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elenia involves different stakeholders in different phases of the construction as much as possible. For example, Elenia reports meetings with land owners, authorities and the general public, intensive co-operation with local and regional media and also social media to give open information to their stakeholders.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The key success factor for underground cabling is the availability of the correct technology for underground cabling, with regard to installation, monitoring and management. Elenia co-operates as much as possible with other underground cabling entities such as telecommunications companies to minimise disturbance to populations through digging activities, as well as reducing costs through collaboration. Although underground cabling could be exposed to new climate hazards, in particular from flooding and soil movements related to landslides, so far these risks remain hypothetical. Excavation due to other construction or maintenance activity represents a key risk of damage to installed underground cables. However, recent Elenia innovations include the application of digitisation and GIS technology to underground cables, with the aim of informing excavators as to the location of underground cables. Although there is no regional focus and the network area is treated consistently, during the first years Elenia focused on the highest density areas, with rural areas to follow.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Finland, the planned investments by Elenia for 2018 are €140 million. The largest costs relate to installation, with a substantial portion of this spent on excavation. Elenia aims to minimize costs by partnering with telecommunications companies for joint excavation efforts where possible. Finland’s 7<sup>th</sup> Communication to the UNFCCC estimates that total investments in distribution networks needed to ensure security of supply (including through underground cabling) will be €2,800 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefits, although not quantified at this stage, will involve more secure energy supply, as well as job provision for excavation and installation work during the required time period. Additionally, there are benefits that are unrelated to climate change adaptation. These include lower visual impact and reduced accident risk e.g. fires and impact associated with broken or fallen cables.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At 2018, a study on the social costs and benefits of underground cabling as a key adaptation measure was under review.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Finnish Electricity Market Act was updated in 2013 to stipulate that by 2028, energy networks must be designed so that storms or snow loads do not cause blackouts lasting more than 6 hours in town areas or more than 36 hours in other areas. This legislation resulted from Finland’s history of problems with severe power outages due to storms and heavy snow loads. Although electricity distribution system operators are able to decide themselves how to tackle this requirement, this legislation was the main driver of underground cabling efforts in the country. Elenia is not the only company undertaking underground cabling efforts in Finland but rather all electricity companies in the country are giving it due consideration, showing significant changes in the sector.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The share of underground cabling in Elenia’s electricity network increased from 38 % in 2016 to 41 % in 2017. This rate gives an indication of the progress towards the target of 75 % by 2028. The implementation time for a particular project varies between several months and several years, depending in particular on the area covered and the length of cables (from a few kilometres up to several hundreds of kilometres). A typical underground cabling project takes 1-2 years, whereby the first year is normally dedicated to project selection and design, and the second year involves actual construction, commissioning and documentation.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[EEA grants supporting the city of Bratislava to implement climate adaptation measures]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bratislava has received funding from “EEA Grants and Norway Grants” (hereafter called EEA Grants) for an urban climate adaptation project. The project entitled ‘Bratislava is preparing for climate change’ implements measures to enhance the resilience of Bratislava city to the adverse impacts of climate change, in particular intense rainfall and heat. These measures include tree planting, green roofs and rainwater retention facilities. The benefits are primarily for the most vulnerable inhabitants of Bratislava: elderly people and children. The € 3.3 million project is for 85% funded by EEA Grants. The remaining 15% comes from the city office and two participating city districts. The main project partners are the city of Bratislava Office, the city districts of Nové Mesto and Petržalka, and the Norwegian partner COWI. But also other stakeholders and knowledge partners (NGOs, Comenius University) are involved to secure exchange of knowledge and coordination of measures.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Bratislava (Slovakia) climate change will be felt particularly in the expected rise in average temperature, more heat waves, and long periods of drought on the one hand, and more extreme rainfall, resulting in an increased risk of local floods.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Bratislava has prepared and approved a strategy on adaptation to climate change and is preparing an Adaptation Action Plan. This plan promotes delivery of climate change adaptation through different types of adaptation measures (with special focus on heat and rainwater management) and cooperation among decision-makers, planners, the private sector and local communities. The main target groups are the inhabitants of Bratislava city, especially the vulnerable groups (elderly people and children). The project ‘Bratislava is preparing for climate change’ practically contributes to the strategy’s implementation and realizes several solutions to relieve heat stress and problems with rainwater discharge.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “EEA Grants and Norway Grants” represent the contribution of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reducing economic and social disparities and to strengthening bilateral relations with 16 EU countries in Central and Southern Europe and the Baltics. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are not EU members but are members to the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement. This type of EEA Grant will distribute € 4 million between projects aiming to find economically efficient and environmentally sustainable adaptation measures to climate change risks through a variety of measures. The minimum grant amount is € 1 million. Cities or city districts with more than 20,000 inhabitants and a municipal area of at least 300 hectares are eligible. Bratislava has successfully applied for funding for its project ‘Bratislava is preparing for climate change’ to finance climate change adaptation measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures address the creation of more green spaces and permeable surfaces in a number of different sub-projects throughout the city. For all of the sub-projects the city of Bratislava organized the process towards implementation (planning, negotiating with the funding organization, design). The sub-projects are partially still in progress and should be finalized in 2017. The sub-projects are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Rehabilitation of a square (Námestie hraničiarov) in the city district of Petržalka of the city of Bratislava. On a square of about 1 ha the pavement will be replaced by grass areas, trees, and flower beds. A water capturing and irrigation system ensures resilience to drought. The project is implemented by the city district of Petržalka, which is - with 100,000 inhabitants - one of the larger and most densely populated districts of Bratislava.</li>
<li>A green roof of 1,000 square meters size on a care home for elderly people owned by the city of Bratislava. The main function is buffering the discharge of excess rainwater.</li>
<li>On two important squares in the city centre – in the historic centre the main square and in the greater Old town the Námestie Slobody (which is bordered by buildings of the Slovak University of Technology and governmental office buildings) - trees have been planted to provide shade on hot days. This very visible result has been realized after very long negotiations with many departments in the city, overcoming arguments on the historic character of the squares, archaeological issues, etc. The project was implemented by the city.</li>
<li>Two tree-lined avenues have been realized, providing cool corridors that connect important big roads in the old town. One consists of 15, the other of 45 large trees. The project was implemented by the city.</li>
<li>In Svoradova street, in an area with previously no green public spaces, a ca. 1,000 square meters park will be realized. It will contain a variety of water retention measures (sustainable drainage systems and underground rain water storage tanks) implemented by the Old town district.</li>
<li>Nové Mesto district was historically an industrialized area with food processing factories and chemical industry. Today the brownfields are being transformed into apartment houses. The former velodrome (about 3 ha) will be revitalized and transformed into a multifunctional leisure area and a new green space for the inhabitants (on a former chestnut plantation) will be created. The newly developed areas will contain various recreational elements for the inhabitants and their children, including playgrounds and visible water flows. The district of Nové Mesto will implement the sub-projects.</li>
<li>In the Bratislava Forest Park - a 19th century designed landscape park – existing water reservoirs of one of the very few remaining streams flowing down from the Male Karpaty mountain range will be revitalized. These are important from the point of view of fire protection of the forests and surrounding areas, but they also support local biodiversity and can take-up excess rain water in times of heavy rainfall which would otherwise flow into the city.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The project ‘Bratislava is preparing for climate change’ also includes a small projects grant scheme for support of sustainable drainage systems. A total amount of € 50,000 will be made available for small projects up to maximum € 1,000 per project. Eligible applicants are private home owners, NGOs and businesses. The grant covers a maximum of 50% of total costs for the small project implementation. It is expected that these will be used for water reservoirs, rainwater gardens, small green roofs, adjustment of pavements, use of permeable materials, etc.  The grant scheme comes with consultancy for applicants and dissemination activities. The applications are assessed by the steering committee of the project, consisting of the Office of the Chief Architect, Department of Strategies and Projects and Department of Environment.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bratislava consists of 17 independent city districts, and the Bratislava City Office provides overall coordination. Bratislava City Office has asked the city districts whether and how they would like to be involved and which sub-projects would be relevant within these districts. Apart from the city districts, cooperation was sought with the Bratislava Regional Conservation Association, Bratislava Water Company, City Committee of Slovak Nature and Landscape Conservation Union, City Forest in Bratislava, Comenius University in Bratislava, Nature Sciences Faculty to involve them in the plans. The Norwegian partner COWI was involved because of its experience in the field and to underline the spirit of the EEA Grants regarding international cooperation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some stakeholders are directly financially involved (as further described below) as they get budget from the grant and bring in some own investment (amounting to 15% of total budget). Other stakeholders are involved to transfer knowledge and to be able to implement mainstream adaptation measures into wider plans, such as on water and nature management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stakeholders that are directly financially involved</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Bratislava City Office. Provides overall management and publicity of the project. The coordination of the ‘Bratislava is preparing for Climate Change’ project is done by a Steering Committee which consists of a chairman (the chief architect of the City) and a number of members, who are representatives of different departments of the Bratislava City Hall, i.e. departments of: strategy project management and financial resources, en-vironment, territorial system coordination, social affairs, transport, infrastructure etc.. The Committee also includes representatives of scientific organizations (i.e. Geograph-ical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and Comenius University in Bratislava) and non-governmental organizations. Depending on the needs of the sub-project under development, the relevant members of the steering committee meet. The steering committee also decides on the grant applications for private sustainable drainage systems.</li>
<li>City district Bratislava - Nové Mesto ‘New Town’ and City district Bratislava – Petržalka. Both city districts are responsible for analysing options to solve problems in their cadastral area and directly implement planned measures in their district. They are also responsible for the communication of the results achieved. During the strategy and action plan development, already existing relations and cooperation with other stakeholders have been further strengthened. The project is promoted through the city districts’ web page.</li>
<li>COWI. It is a consulting group which has more than 80 years of experience in the environmental protection sector. Their experience and knowledge has been a valuable asset in the project implementation, mainly in the engineering phase, the implementation of measures, communication and the exchange of experiences and the dissemination of project results. COWI has received budget for travelling to enable the cooperation with Bratislava and has provided assistance in problem solving and the establishment of future cooperation with other sectors in Norway.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stakeholders without financial contribution</strong></p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Bratislava Regional Conservation Association (BROZ). It is an NGO focused on nature, landscape and environment conservation. As a project partner, this association contributes to the sustainable management of city forest area and to the development of a local system of ecological stability.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Bratislava Water Company (BVS, a.s.). It is a joint stock company including also Bratislava City among its share-holders. It provides its professional services and technical assistance during sub- projects implementation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Slovak Nature and Landscape Conservation Union (SZOPK). It is an umbrella NGO focused on nature, landscape and environment conservation. Its branch office located in Bratislava City participates in the project as legal entity. It promotes communication with the general public, local communities and it helps increase public awareness about the project.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">City Forest Company in Bratislava. This company is incorporated in the Statute of Bratislava Forest Park. Some proposed measures are implemented in Bratislava Forest Park so the City Forest Company needs to be involved in the project.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Nature Sciences Faculty of Comenius University in Bratislava. The university is an educational and scientific institution. It provides professional advice and methodical assistance for the Adaptation Action Plan.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the ‘EU Cities Adapt project’ - a project of the European Commission run during 2012-2013 and aimed at capacity building for adaptation strategies for European cities - the city of Bratislava was one of the selected cities for the training phase. Within this project Bratislava established a working group in which the City Chief Architect and all relevant departments within the city participated. This working group identified the climate risks of the city, engaged external stakeholders and developed a draft adaptation strategy. This work formed the basis of the proposal to apply for EEA Grants. In the meantime the adaption strategy was developed into a draft climate adaptation action plan. This predecessor project helped the city review its climate risks and corresponding adaptation needs and formed the basic project idea and objectives. Therefore it was one of the two key success factors in obtaining the funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the good support from the Government Office of the Slovak Republic, which has an EEA Grants Department, and the user-friendly application procedure of the EEA grant facilitated the process of applying for the necessary project funding. Bratislava City Office applied for funding under an EEA Grants open call in order to implement a number of measures that were identified during the development of the climate adaptation action plan. The timing of the call fitted perfectly with the stage of development of the action plan which is currently being finalised.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two limiting factors contributing to some delays can be highlighted as follows:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">First, a limiting factor have been the complex procedures for the implementation of measures in terms of permits and obligations for public works, time consuming public procurement procedures, and archaeological aspects that have to be taken into account in a historical city.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Another limiting factor is that the Bratislava districts themselves have their independent governance structure which makes it more difficult for Bratislava City Office to coordinate processes.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Total project costs for the whole ‘Bratislava is preparing for Climate Change’ project are € 3,337,640, of which € 2,411,445 come from EEA Grants (Adaptation to Climate Change - Flood and Drought Prevention, priority sector Climate Change). The remaining € 926,195 comes from the Bratislava City office and the City Districts of Nové Mesto and Petržalka. The budget was divided over the partners according to their contribution to sub-projects and project management tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The grant holder of the project is the Bratislava City Office. It provides management: project coordinator, accountant, managers for publicity and particular activities. The project is monitored through regular reporting to the EEA Grants provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costs of the total project are management costs, publicity, small grants, and construction activities. The benefits of the project and related sub-projects are difficult to directly express in terms of money. Financial benefits are for example related to less damage caused by flooding during expected intense rainfalls, and better health conditions leading to less medical and societal costs for vulnerable people during heat-waves by providing areas with shade. Apart from climate change aspects, green spaces in general contribute to well-being. In addition, the cooperation among project partners and exchange of experience and knowledge that are built up during this project will pave the way for future projects to implement the Adaptation Action Plan.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Local regulations limit the application of some of the adaptation options. For example, Bratislava has a regulation to prevent soil pollution from parking places, stating that they should have an impermeable surface and a space to collect oily water. This precludes the use of permeable pavement on parking places, which otherwise would be perfectly suited for increasing the infiltration of rainwater. The local situation, with lots of underground parking garages, precludes planting of trees in many places. On the other hand, the Masterplan of Bratislava requires 10-60% of newly developed plots to be green; the percentage depending on the district and the type of building. This requirement is little overseen, however. The final version of the Adaptation Action Plan itself still has to be approved by the City Executive Board which consists of the City Mayor, all city district mayors and the deputy mayors and other members up to a count of 10, who are elected by the City Council.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole project started in 2014 and is scheduled to finish in 2017. Due to time-consuming procedures for permits and public procurement the implementation time is expected to extend beyond the official end date of the project.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[GAIA - Green Area Inner-city Agreement to finance tree planting in Bologna]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bologna, like many Southern European cities, is facing drought, extreme temperatures and water scarcity as a result of climate change. With no national or regional adaptation action plan still in place, the city of Bologna took it upon themselves to draft an Adaptation Plan to Climate Change. The plan, which was approved by the City Council on October 2015, focuses on the development of innovative, concrete measures that could be tested locally. These measures were developed as part of the LIFE+ project BLUE AP (Bologna Local Urban Environment Adaptation Plan for a Resilient City). One of the successful initiatives that contribute to reach the local target is the “green areas inner-city agreement” (developed within Life+ project GAIA). This initiative shows how the financing and realisation of additional green areas in the city to provide relief under heat waves was successfully undertaken.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bologna, a city of 387,000 inhabitants in the centre of Italy, is facing problems with droughts and extreme temperatures as a result of climate change. In January of 2016 the total amount of rain measured was around 60% less than the seasonal average of the Bologna area. The effects are becoming visible in the water levels of the Italian lakes, which have decreased by 12%. These problems with water availability have been partially attributed to urban deforestation. Trees extract groundwater through their roots and release it into the atmosphere thus contributing to the availability of atmospheric moisture vapour. This raises the likelihood of the occurrence of precipitation events and increases the water yield, in particular in continental areas that are more distant from oceans. Deforestation means that there are fewer trees available to transpire water, eventually resulting in a much drier climate.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With no national or regional adaptation action plan still in place, Bologna needed to find a way to develop a stand-alone climate plan and actions that could be financed without national or regional funds. Planting trees is a major action. The city needed to find a financing model to implement this measure.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city decided to create the ‘green areas inner-city agreement’ (GAIA) based on a public-private partnership model to finance tree planting. Trees can provide necessary cooling during heat waves through evaporation and transpiration, which creates a natural air conditioning effect.  Consequently, tree foliage can help to reduce overall temperatures in the city by 4.5 C. The planted trees increase the number of areas with shade in the city and reduce groundwater withdrawals through their capacity of releasing water that they have extracted through their roots into the atmosphere. They also help to preserve vulnerable areas such as river banks and landslides areas through their roots. In addition, green areas can help to decrease air pollution in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The GAIA mechanism is based on the idea to use financial compensation for the carbon footprint of businesses as a main driver for action. The financial compensation is used to purchase plants and maintain trees throughout the city. Participation of the town council and local businesses in the GAIA initiative is on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A business that is interested in participating in GAIA can request an easy-to-use tool from the project website. This tool allows businesses to calculate the quantity of carbon dioxide involved in their processes and services. Next the businesses can select the type of partnerships they would like to purchase to neutralize their carbon footprint. The basic partnership is the ELDER TREE PARTNERSHIP, which consists of purchasing 1 to 5 trees. This partnership entails a cost between € 200 and € 1,000. A company that purchases 6 to 20 trees becomes a MAPLE PARTNER. This partnership costs between € 1,200 and € 4,000. Finally, a company can purchase more than 20 trees and become an ELM PARTNER. The costs of this partnership are minimally € 4,200. The number of trees required to compensate the company’s carbon footprint is calculated according to the amount of carbon dioxide which will be absorbed. This is an indicative number; the company makes the final decision on how many trees it wishes to purchase to compensate its emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Bologna has developed clear guidelines that detail the different steps that need to be taken in the process and which party is responsible. The city identifies the cost components, approves the Protocol of Agreement, takes the initiative to start the planting works and pays the tree suppliers. The city also commits to providing a monitoring report every 6 months from the start of the partnership. The company needs to initiate the partnership by providing an expression of interest and sending its data to the city. Once the type of partnership is selected, the company is asked to sign the Protocol. With this Protocol the company agrees to buy the trees and finance the first 3 years of maintenance. A guideline has been developed within the project detailing these steps involved to aid other municipalities or authorities that want to implement the partnership in their own city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was initially tested through 3 pilot areas; 116 trees were planted in the urban park Villa Angeletti, the industrial district Roveri and Palazzo D’Accursio, which is an area in the city centre. Several other green areas, such as urban parks, hillside parks and local recreational areas, have been selected for the GAIA project. In total 23 areas in Bologna were identified at the start of the project that together have a potential of planting 3,000 trees. They all belong to Bologna Town Council and meet a set of requirements: they need to enable trees to absorb carbon dioxide, have environmental value in terms of conservation of biodiversity and protection of the territory, provide a revitalization of the area and social value and have an appropriate geographic location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, the GAIA project contributes to the climate adaptation objectives of the Bologna Adaptation Plan to increase the number of green spaces in urban areas and promote urban safety in the face of extreme weather events. Trees have the capacity to increase soil cohesion and therefore can help to prevent landslides and erosion from occurring. On June 4th 2014 the city council approved the signing of “Mayors Adapt”. Bologna was the first Italian city to join the initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project includes a study through which the shading capacity per tree was assessed. It also established the potential evapotranspiration values of tree species to ensure that a decrease of the urban heat island effect could be realised. These values have been published in a technical guidebook as part of the project. The GAIA project has been complemented by actions to improve emergency management and communication with citizens about heat waves. There are further developments with Bologna currently implementing a GAIA spin-off project for citizens called RADICI. This project is financed through crowdfunding.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The GAIA project consisted of a public-private partnership from the start. Each of the partners involved brought in their own expertise. The Institute of Biometeorology of the National Research Council (IBIMET) supported on the development of scientific guidelines. Impronta Etica, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), helped to develop the partnership model. Unindustria Bologna, an association of entrepreneurs in Bologna, focused on the involvement of enterprises. Finally, Cittalia, a local branch of the National association of Italian cities and municipalities focused on research activities, provided support in the communication and dissemination needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project also included the set-up of a body that controls the partnership model and procedures for the selection and planting of green areas. The GAIA Management Group, which consists of the G. Marconi Airport of Bologna, the Coop Adriatica, Enel, Gruppo Hera, Gruppo Unipol, La Perla, Manutencoop and M. Casale Bauer, was created to function as a first promoter at the start of the project. A further 11 businesses joined the project during the experimental phase. They are GD, Interporto, Bologna Fiere, Granarolo, Mec-Track, Cadiai, STS, BRT S.p.A., Indica Srl, Piccoli Motori srl and PS Mobile srl.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As of April 2016 GAIA has realised the planting of 1,405 trees in the Bologna city area. The success of the project depends on the driver, i.e. the effort of companies to compensate their carbon dioxide emissions. To provide scientific evidence supporting the project implementation, several studies were conducted, including calculations on the estimated carbon dioxide storage capacity for 24 species of trees. Technical calculations were also conducted to estimate the capacity of trees in decreasing fine dust, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and gaseous pollutants as well as their capacity in terms of temperature reduction. Pre-selection of these species was based on both scientific knowledge and a specific set of requirements that was provided by the Bologna town council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Bologna has received some interest from other cities in Italy that would like to replicate the project, such as the city of Bari, the city of Sassari and the city of Cagliari. The project does show several ‘spin-off’ activities among companies. Two companies of the GAIA Promoting Group, Hera S.p.A and UNIPOL, have exported the GAIA model to other cities in which they operate through the implementation of a local project. Other companies demonstrated an increased awareness of their carbon footprint after the GAIA project. Overall the process was a very positive experience in cooperation for the city of Bologna, where all partners did their best to meet the project deadlines and objectives and to work in a transparent and very proficient way. GAIA provides mutual benefits for all actors as further detailed also in the “Costs and Benefits” section.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial phase of the GAIA project was realised on a budget of 1,202,000 euros. Approximately half of this sum was financed with support of European Life funding. This sum was mainly used for the development of the instruments itself, the guidelines and the technical and scientific document. The city used its own funds to attune the process based on feedback of the initial results. The minimum contribution of a company purchasing a tree is 200 euros (incl. taxes). It represents the average purchase and maintenance costs of the tree as the real costs vary for the different tree species. It also takes the average market price of carbon dioxide into account. 1,405 trees have been sold up till April 2016, which represents a total contribution by companies of 281,000 euros. This amount was enough to cover the expenditures involved in the purchase and maintenance of the trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies that participate in GAIA obtain different benefits depending on the type of partnership that they select. In exchange for their investment, businesses receive a free audit to calculate their carbon dioxide offset potential and workshops on the main environmental issues related to their business. In addition, they can obtain various additional (marketing) benefits for their company. These benefits range from a GAIA plate in the green created areas to the opportunity to speak at a GAIA conference. In addition, the project keeps businesses informed on the opportunities arising from the green economy and the public-private co-operation network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On signing a statement of intent, the council agrees to plant the trees, cover any unexpected maintenance costs for the first 3 years and provide project progress updates. The private entity agrees to pay the chosen contribution, which covers the purchase, the planting and ordinary maintenance of the trees for 3 years. These maintenance costs include watering, trimming, removal, weeding and substitution in case of dry out. After the third year, these ordinary maintenance costs come at the expense of the Municipality of Bologna.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is now able to run as a self-sufficient initiative, although so far the investments costs for the development of the project are not covered by the selling price of the trees. However, the financial benefits are not the only consideration of the city; the social benefits are as important. For example; the project has enabled the city to raise awareness among companies of the carbon dioxide production involved in their production processes and practices and stimulate the local economy by offering opportunities to the companies to market themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bologna is currently implementing a GAIA spin-off project for citizens called RADICI. This project is financed through crowdfunding. Cities that would like to implement a similar model as GAIA will need to invest less than Bologna as they can use the project material that has been developed through the project. However, to obtain good results cities are advised to make some financial support available.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The GAIA project requires a legal agreement that allows a private entity to engage in a financial transaction with a public authority. This type of intervention can be carried out in various ways. The intervention through which a private entity contributes to works, services and other activities aimed at the community can be classified as either charitable donations or donations, sponsorships or direct payment of the invoices by the municipality. Each type of intervention has different rules and implementation modalities. For a non-profit organization, a received donation is a non-taxable income. In the case of sponsorships, the activity is considered as business activity, and as such it is subject to V.A.T. and to direct taxation. The analysis demonstrated that the charitable donation was the most advantageous option in the case of the GAIA agreement.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Mainstreaming adaptation in water management for flood protection in Isola Vicentina]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Isola Vicentina (Italy) signed the EU’s Mayors Adapt initiative (current Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy) in 2014 and since then started the elaboration process of its Municipal Water Management Plan (MWMP) in order to integrate climate change adaptation into its water management policies. For this purpose, Isola Vicentina Mayor engaged the “Planning Climate Change” research group at the IUAV University of Venice and Green-Dev studio, a local consultancy firm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan analysed each drainage basin, river and stream flowing through the municipality, evaluating their maximum water flow rate and flood-wave size with different return periods (5, 10, 20, 30, 100, 300-years). The adaptation measures promoted by the plan took into account the statistically evaluated dimension of extreme flooding events according to these different return periods, including climate change effects. Identified critical issues were the starting point to plan prevention and preparedness measures, as well as about 50 punctual protection measures. The plan was approved by the end of 2016 and planned measures will be implemented from 2017 to 2022. A few structural and non-structural measures are being already implemented; specifically: (i) a management and maintenance regulation framework over small private ditches was adopted, (ii) one of the three planned water retention areas is now under construction, and (iii) a ten-hectare pilot area was identified to simulate how the preservation of woodlands can improve the resilience of the municipal territory to flooding and landslides.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Isola Vicentina is prone to flooding stemming from both the main rivers (i.e. Orolo and Timonchio) and the minor local drainage network (e.g. land reclamation channels, rural and roadside ditches, urban drains). The last main river flood occurred in 2010: fortunately, the municipal area was only partially affected (producing low damage), while the event was much more damaging in the downstream municipalities (e.g. Caldogno, Vicenza). On the contrary, pluvial flooding is a frequent event: almost every year, small and patchy– both urban and rural – areas get flooded due to rain events, leading to relevant cumulative damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the near future, global warming is expected to alter precipitation quantity and patterns, and to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events. For the Veneto Region, according to latest studies regional models outputs exhibit a general tendency to less frequent and more intense precipitation events (even if the expected changes are weak and their quantitative projections uncertain), thus leading to a likely increase in the occurrence of flood events. Given that – at such local scale – quantitative projections or scenarios of future events are not available, the MWMP took in consideration climate change effects for the flood frequency estimation also considering the more extreme events: the 100 and 300-year return periods were evaluated and precautionary principle considered in the design of flood risk reduction measures, thus extensively exceeding current design standards.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MWMPs are local plans (until now in force only in the Veneto Region) born as coordination tools between municipalities and land reclamation authorities. Their objective is to allow a shared analysis of the local drainage system, getting an accurate picture over administrative and maintenance responsibilities, to identify the most urgent (and locally relevant) problems of poor drainage and the related flood protection measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Isola Vicentina, the MWMP has been set up with a more ambitious adaptation approach: the idea is to transform the MWMP in a local flood adaptation plan which couples prevention, protection and preparedness strategies. Suggesting how to modify the physical structure of built-up areas, as well as citizens’ behaviour and social organization, the plan tries to reduce the long-term potential damage (up to flood with a return period of 1/300 years) generated by climate change. In other words, the MWMP aims to solve current and future local hydraulic problems acting also on the vulnerability of buildings, infrastructure and people, promoting sustainable land use practices and bridging this new climate adapted knowledge into other sectorial spatial planning tools.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The analyses carried within the MWMP put together different flood hazard data:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The hazard stemming from the main river network was taken from official maps and plans: the Hydrogeological Plan (<em>Piano di Assetto Idrogeologico</em> in Italian); the new Eastern Alps’ Flood Risk Management Plan, etc.;</li>
<li>Local authorities (such as <em>Alto Vicentino</em> land reclamation authority, civil protection organisations, municipal authority, etc.) have been involved to collect information on historical events generated by the local drainage system;</li>
<li>Finally, citizens’ local knowledge and direct experience was directly surveyed through consultative public meetings.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Results were then compared and integrated with those coming from the MWMP’s flood frequency estimation and local conveyance capacity analysis. This process led to the identification of more than 20 areas suffering poor drainage or flooding issues. Several measures were identified for each critical area. As suggested by the Flood Directive (2007/60/EC), the proposed measures were divided into three main typologies:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Prevention measures, aiming to prevent damage occurrence avoiding new developments in flood-prone areas, structurally adapting urban fabrics and reducing soil-sealing and surface runoff generation through Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). A purely theoretical scenario prepared during the MWMP elaboration showed a potential decrease in the flood extent of about 40% (compared to the present land use) if the whole un-built area would be reforested. Thanks to this information, the municipal authority gained a better understanding on the need to preserve woodlands, and is now envisaging to convert some grassland and uncultivated fields into wooded areas. Moreover, a ten-hectare pilot area was identified to simulate in reality how the preservation of woodlands can improve the resilience of the municipal territory to flooding and landslides.</li>
<li>Protection measures, aiming to reduce the likelihood of floods and/or the impact of floods in a specific location, such as restoring flood plains and wetlands, building flood defences or enhancing the conveyance capacity of the drainage network. About 50 protection measures were identified and planned within the MWMP, including: cleaning up rivers and streams, enlarging existing ditches, opening new roadside ditches, creating new retention areas, widening the existing urban drainage network, etc. In particular, a water retention area is already going through the design and implementation phases, thanks to a regional funding. The retention measure (with a water capacity of about 1 million cubic meters) is located in a South area of the Isola Vicentina Municipality, on the Orolo River. It mainly aims to protect downstream municipalities (in particular Vicenza) from the main river floods, reducing and temporarily storing a portion of the flood-wave.</li>
<li>Preparedness measures, aiming to provide instructions to citizens on how to react/respond in case of flooding events. Starting from the existing documents and guidelines produced by the Italian civil protection service, Isola Vicentina citizens have been equipped with a booklet on what to do before/during/after a flood in their territory. Moreover, citizens were trained through a cycle of 4 public workshops.</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During the MWMP elaboration process – through four public workshops – citizens and local stakeholders were consulted and involved in order to envisage locally suited flood risk reduction measures, and gather feedback on the proposed actions. Final MWMP measures were selected comparing the results obtained from the hydrologic/hydraulic analysis with people’s priorities and feedback. Beyond the general public, targeted key stakeholder groups (such as farmers, business people and the landowners of flood-prone areas) were explicitly invited. Around 200 people participated to these meetings. In general, all participants were highly motivated since the 2010 flood affected adjacent municipalities, generating fear and increasing the relevance of the issue in the public opinion. Consequently, these workshops were also used to spread flood risk awareness and train people on how to cope with extreme weather conditions. Finally, given the existence of non-structural measures directly involving all the inhabitants in the local water management, the public participation and consultation process was also aimed to spread good practices and behavioral daily guidelines (e.g. on management and maintenance of small water courses).</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The elaboration of the MWMP, according to an adaptive approach has been possible thanks to the determination of the municipal government of Isola Vicentina, the scientific support of the IUAV University and the field work carried out by municipal and technical consultants. A relevant role was also played by the whole citizenship, who was directly involved in site surveys and in the identification of the most critical areas (thanks to their past experience of flooding).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the plan has been hampered by two main elements:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A single municipality was in charge of the MWMP, without an official coordination with surrounding municipalities: as a consequence, downstream municipalities will benefit from the implementation of some risk reduction measures, whereas some critical issues generated outside (upstream) Isola Vicentina could not be solved by the plan.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The definition of the exact responsibilities of each stakeholder group (including farmers for agricultural practices and rural drainage; home-owners for cleaning of private urban ditches and reduction of soil-sealing; water companies for urban storm-water management) over the various drainage system components was not easy to be agreed.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost for the elaboration of the MWMP was €25.000. According to the plan, the cost for structural protection measures range from about €2 million (up to flood with a return period of 1/50 years) to about €4 million (up to flood with a return period of 1/100 years). Minor interventions will be paid (or directly realized) by the municipal authority and private citizen. Major works, involving wider areas and catchments going beyond the municipal boundary, will require the economic contribution of the “<em>Alta Pianura Veneta”</em> land reclamation authority (a public-private consortium made up of all landowners in the area of competence) and of the Veneto Region government, the availability of which will depend upon the political choices of the next years. Considering that the total damage of the 2010 flood exceeded €400 million, and that damages for €80 million affected just the Caldogno municipality, which is just downstream Isola Vicentina, the convenience of the planned risk reduction measures clearly emerges.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole MWMP elaboration was inspired by the flood risk management approach suggested by the Flood Directive (2007/60/EC), focused on prevention, protection and preparedness strategies. A specific chapter of the MWMP explicitly lists all the regional and national laws related to the plan, among which the major ones are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Lgs. 152/2006 (Italian environment act);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Lgs. 49/2010 (Italian Flood Directive implementation act);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">G.R. 3637/2002 - D.G.R. 1322/2006 - D.G.R. 1841/2007 - D.G.R. 2948/2009 (Veneto Region: standards for stormwater and flood management in urban areas);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">R. 11/2004 (Veneto Region: spatial planning act);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">R. 12/2009 (Veneto Region: land reclamation act);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">D.G.R. 427/2013 (Veneto Region Spatial Plan, which includes the MWMP directive.</li>
</ul>]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The MWMP elaboration process started in October 2015 and was concluded in June 2016. Planned measures will be implemented from 2017 to 2022, considering two 3-years steps. The implementation of the first measures already started with: (i) the adoption of management and maintenance regulation framework over private ditches, (ii) the design and construction of a water retention area in a southeast area of the municipality, (iii) the designation of a ten-hectares pilot area where to simulate how the preservation of woodlands can improve the resilience of the whole municipality to flooding and landslides.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[The Watermachine: multifunctional area for flood protection and improved water quality - Kristalbad, Enschede]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Kristalbad is an area of about 40 hectares located in the east of the Netherlands between the cities of Enschede (160.000 inhabitants) and Hengelo (81.000 inhabitants). This is one of the last remaining green areas between these two cities, playing a role for ecosystem-based adaptation to cope with potential climate change related impacts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the Swedish concept of “Watermachine”, the seven public partners involved in the Kristalbad project are transforming Kristalbad into a multi-functional area. The Watermachine makes use of different elevation levels to create a water flow between different compartments of the area to naturally purify the water. Moreover, these compartments are able to store water for a total capacity of 187.000 m<sup>3</sup>, thus contributing to flood protection. Indeed, the cities of Hengelo and Enschede have been affected by floods in the past years, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity because of climate change. Besides flood protection and improvement of water quality, this area also functions as an ecological connecting zone and is used for recreational activities.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Flood and drought risks, water quality improvement and biodiversity conservation are among the most relevant challenges of the cities of Enschede and Hengelo. Climate change is expected to increase flood and drought related risks and make other challenges more severe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2010 and 2013 floods caused inundation of tunnels, detours due to flooding of the international highway and roads, and large material damage due to flooded basements. Until recently, flooding water was discharged as fast as possible by the Twente canal. However, due to increased occurrence of drought during summer periods (in particular dry summers are impacting farmers and natural areas) water retention in the area is recommended in order to deal with drought risks. Furthermore, the area has the challenge to increase water quality to fulfill the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Finally, Kristalbad is an important nature area that is part of the Dutch ecological network. It is one of the last green areas between the two cities of Hengelo and Enschede and plays a significant role in plant and animal species migration: the challenge is to conserve this area and improve its biodiversity.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of Kristalbad was to re-develop the area in a multi-functional way by finding a solution for the above mentioned challenges. In terms of flood risk the project aims to provide a water store capacity to be used during cloudbursts and intensive rainfall events and therefore protect the nearby cities and the transport network. At the same time the objective is to improve purification of stored water in an ecological way and develop the ecological connecting zone. Thanks to water purification, the water can be used for agricultural purposes, providing therefore a way to cope with drought. In addition, the objective is to develop the area for recreational use and with special attention to improve the landscape quality.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The adopted solution was the implementation of the “Watermachine” concept, developed in Sweden and aiming to exploit natural mechanisms to address Kristalbad challenges (flood and drought risks, water quality improvement and biodiversity conservation). The Kristalbad Watermachine is a natural area that is divided into several compartments mutually interconnected. These compartments are periodically filled with water coming from the Elsebeek River, rainfall and the wastewater treatment plant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kristalbad is able to cope with the flood risks caused by heavy rainfall by storing a total water capacity of 187.000 m<sup>3</sup>. This storage capacity is able to keep the water out of the nearby urban areas in the city of Hengelo and Enschede during extreme rainfall events. At the same time stored water can limit drought impacts on crops and farmland as well as on natural habitats during dry summers. The water entering in the Watermachine normally has a moderate quality and is poor in terms of aquatic life. The compartments use different elevation levels in order to induce the water to flow throughout the area. It takes about four hours for the water to flow through the compartments back into the Elsebeek River. During this flowing, the water is purified by natural processes that combine light, air and vegetation processes to breakdown chemicals and other contaminants in the water. Consequently, the water is cleaner and suitable for aquatic life. The purified water is also used to increase groundwater levels and for recreational purposes. Kristalbad natural area plays a relevant role within the Dutch ecological network; attention was paid to realize in the area connectivity measures (like ecological corridors) and measures aiming to improve important habitats (such as breeding sites) in order to preserve local biodiversity.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The first ideas about re-development of the Kristalbad area were formulated in 2008. The cities of Enschede and Hengelo were involved in the re-development project, together with the Waterboard Vechtstromen, which is the organisation responsible for water management in the region. Also the NGO Landscape Overijssel, the province of Overijssel and competent national ministries were consulted to support the requalification project. A project team of 7 public authorities was set-up to carry out the project. This team worked intensively to develop the plan and to carry out its implementation. Citizens as such were not actively involved in the process but were informed and consulted on a regular basis. The citizens were represented by the so-called ‘esthetical commission’. This is a commission that is composed of architects that provide advice to local policymakers on development plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After its elaboration, the plan of the multi-functional area was submitted to the local councils and the national government for formal approval. Approval was easily obtained because these authorities were intensely consulted during the plan development. In this way, their pre-conditions for approval were integrated in the elaborated plan. To raise citizens’ awareness of the importance of the area, Kristalbad is promoted by communication activities.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Kristalbad has been successful because policymakers from the local, regional and national governments were involved in developing and carrying the re-development project since the beginning. All actors were very much willing to implement this multi-functional area and the Watermachine concept has been considered a good solution to the multiple regional challenges. The strong involvement of governmental actors has helped to get the project formally approved and to organise all the required permissions for its implementation. Furthermore, the project has also gained social support because of the generated benefits for inhabitants and tourists, as they can use the area for walking, cycling and other recreational activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the limiting factors was that subsidy requests included very strict deadlines. This means that the process of the development of the plan had to speed up tremendously in order to be able to achieve funding.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total costs of the re-development of Kristalbad area was about €6 million euros. This budget includes costs related to research, planning and design activities, communication costs and costs related to the implementation of the Watermachine measures and recreation facilities. This budget does not include the amounts of money paid by the public authorities to buy the land where the Watermachine was constructed. Funding was provided by the national, provincial and local governments involved in the planning and implementation of Kristalbad, integrated with subsidies provided by the national government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefits of this project are avoided costs of flood damage and of water purification done with alternative technological solutions. Benefits include also availability of good quality water during dry period. In addition, the area is used for recreational activities by citizens and tourists and there are signals that the improved landscape conditions will result in improved biodiversity. Till now, more than 150 different species of water-birds have been spotted in the area.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is supported by the spatial planning and environmental laws (Wet op de Ruimtelijke Ordening, Wet Milieubeheer). The policy instruments that are connected to these laws were used to implement the project.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Environment-friendly urban street design for decentralized ecological rainwater management in Ober-Grafendorf, Lower Austria]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The municipality of Ober-Grafendorf is located at an elevation of 280 m in a typical pre-Alpine landscape in the Mostviertel region in the western part of the Austrian province Lower Austria. With 4,612 inhabitants on a municipal territory of 24.6 km<sup>2</sup>, Ober-Grafendorf has a population size only slightly above the statistical average of Austrian municipalities, and it is among the 98% of Austrian municipalities with less than 20.000 inhabitants. In recent years, more frequent and more intense heavy precipitation events alternating with more pronounced drought periods have caused increasing challenges for municipal development. Excess surface water runoff from sealed surface areas has repeatedly caused small-scale flooding, overloading of the sewer and wastewater treatment system, and rising costs for its maintenance. On the other hand, during hot and dry periods the cost for irrigating and maintaining the urban greenery has been rising constantly. Based on observed climatic trends and climate projections, it is anticipated that these problems will be exacerbated by future climate change. The municipality has responded by implementing a smart, ecosystem-based rainwater management system that is incorporated into an environment-friendly street design. The adaptation solution helps to reduce public costs, delivers multiple benefits and holds considerable innovation potential for sustainable and climate-sensitive local road construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning of the adaptation measure was embedded in a regional pilot adaptation process conducted within the Interreg project <a href="http://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/metadata/projects/c3-alps-2013-capitalising-climate-change-knowledge-for-adaptation-in-the-alpine-space">C3-Alps</a>. From 2011 to 2014, the process has succeeded in setting adaptation on local agendas, building adaptive capacities and triggering adaptation actions in seven municipalities in the Mostviertel region, including Ober-Grafendorf.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Alpine Austrian municipalities are increasingly affected by climate change impacts, such as local extreme weather events (heavy precipitation, hailstorms), heat waves, droughts, declining snow cover, floods, and gravitational natural hazard events (debris flows, landslides, torrential processes, rockfall). A range of adverse effects on environmental systems, physical structures, human health, and socio-economic activities of all sectors (e.g., infrastructure, water supply, energy provision, forestry, tourism) is already causing frequent damages in municipalities, creating consequential costs to municipal households, and often jeopardizing municipal development potentials over the long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other local communities in the province of Lower Austria, the municipality of Ober-Grafendorf in the Mostviertel region has in recent years increasingly been affected by heavy precipitation events, on the one hand, and by more frequent and more pronounced drought periods, on the other hand. Due to the combined effect of heavy rainfall events and incremental soil sealing in the wake of ongoing settlement growth, excess surface water runoff from sealed surface areas has been causing overloading of sewage water systems and small-scale flooding of residential areas more and more frequently. The consequences are costly damages to properties and the built environment as well as rising costs for pumping out the sewerage and for operating the municipal wastewater treatment plant. The resulting maintenance and repair costs are causing substantial additional pressure on the municipal budget, which – as in most other municipalities - is strained by high investment and operation costs for the urban sewage and water sanitation infrastructure as well as for flood retention structures, anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, in times of prolonged droughts the cost and effort for irrigating and maintaining the vegetation in urban green spaces has been increasing constantly, and the effects of more intense heat waves on human health and wellbeing are already being felt even in comparatively small rural municipalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annual mean temperature has already risen by +2°C in Austria, compared to pre-industrial times. According to most recent regional climate change scenarios for the province of Lower Austria (<a href="https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/umwelt/klimaschutz/klimapolitik_national/anpassungsstrategie/klimaszenarien.html">Chimani et al. 2016a</a>), which are based on the new Climate Scenarios for Austria (<a href="https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/umwelt/klimaschutz/klimapolitik_national/anpassungsstrategie/klimaszenarien.html">Chimani et al. 2016b</a>), annual mean temperature is projected to increase further by +1.3°C to 1.4°C in the period 2021 to 2050 (compared to the period 1971-2000) and may rise up to +3.9°C under a business-as-usual representative concentration path (RCP8.5) in the period 2071 to 2100, with the strongest seasonal increase occurring in winter (+4.4°C). The average annual number of hot days (defined as days with the maximum daily temperature exceeding 30°C) in Lower Austria may increase from 6 hot days per year at present to 29 hot days per year until the end of the century. Though being subject to higher uncertainties, climate models also forecast an increase in annual mean precipitation of up to +11 % under a business-as-usual scenario until the end of the century and significant changes to seasonal precipitation amounts in the entire province, with an increase of +25.6% of precipitation amounts being possible during winter. Maximum daily precipitation amounts are simulated to increase significantly and in a progressive way in larger parts of Austria over the long term (RCP4.5: 16,2%; RCP8.5: 23,5%; both for the period 2071-2100), with the strongest changes of +20% to +40% occurring in winter in the north and east of Austria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having already been active in the fields of local energy efficiency, climate mitigation and environmental protection for years, the municipality of Ober-Grafendorf recognized the growing challenges to urban development induced by climate change and decided to test and implement an innovative local adaptation measure in a new municipal development area.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project “eco-street” (“Ökostraße”) implemented in the municipality of Ober-Grafendorf represents a smart, decentralised, ecological rainwater management system based on an environment-friendly urban street design (DrainGarden®). The main objective was to avoid flooding of built-up areas by draining excess surface water in case of heavy precipitation events from the sealed street surface to unsealed road-side zones planted with greenery, whose specific design allows retention, storage and filtering of the rainwater. Equally important goals were to avoid public costs for construction and maintenance of additional sewage pipes, and to reduce costs and energy inputs for operation of pumping stations and sewage treatment facilities. At the same time, the adaptation measure aims at generating co-benefits, such as improvement of the urban micro-climate through plant transpiration, cooling effects during summerly heat waves, visual upgrade of the townscape, and reduction of costs and efforts for irrigating and maintaining the urban greenery. The measure is intended as an innovative pilot and demonstration adaptation activity that shall serve as a model solution also for other cities and municipalities. Permanent scientific monitoring shall support customized applications in other contexts and locations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The local adaptation measure in Ober-Grafendorf was developed and implemented as part of a regional pilot adaptation process within the transnational EU project C3-Alps – ‘Capitalising Climate Change Knowledge for Adaptation in the Alpine Space’ (Interreg Alpine Space Programme 2007-2013). The overall goal of the pilot activities conducted in the frame of the project in regions across the Alps was to put climate adaptation on local and regional agendas and to pave the way for implementation of concrete adaptation activities and measures. In the Mostviertel region, seven pilot municipalities participated in the process, including Ober-Grafendorf.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project “eco-street” (“Ökostraße”) in the municipality of Ober-Grafendorf is an environment-friendly urban street design for decentralized ecological rainwater management. In response to recurring heavy precipitation events causing small-scale flooding, overload situations of the sewage system and rising costs for maintenance works, the measure was realised in a new urban development area at a street section of 100 meters length and 11 meters width in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “eco-street” concept, which has been protected under the name DrainGarden®, is a system of vegetated, aesthetically appealing roadside surface strips covered with special substrates of natural origin and planted with greenery that are able to absorb, retain, store and filter large amounts of water in short time. The specifically developed soil substrates are layered in a way as to combine high water permeability with high storage capacities. In case of heavy rainfall the water is not flowing from streets and other paved surfaces into the sewer, but into the green areas. Each cubic metre of substrate can store up to 500 litres of water. As it is required by regulations in place for conventional water retention structures, the system is designed to assure flood protection up to heavy precipitation events with a 100 year return interval. The water remains available to the plants, is filtered by the substrate and allowed to infiltrate slowly into the groundwater body. The micro-climatic effect of the water used by the plants for transpiration equates to the cooling capacity of a 100-years-old beech tree on a hot summer day and is able to reduce the local temperature by up to 5°C during heat periods. Further environmental co-benefits include the storage of CO<sub>2</sub> by plants and substrate, the containment of growth of sealed soil, an increase in urban green spaces, and visual improvement of the townscape.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system allows the municipality to avoid investment costs for construction of additional sewage pipes as well as regular operational costs for maintaining the sewerage and operating pumping facilities. In addition, the existing urban water drainage system is disburdened, and costs for operating the municipal wastewater treatment facility as well as for irrigation and maintenance of the urban greenery are reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Selection of the right plant species is a crucial factor for success of the measure. Apart from being in compliance with road safety standards, the greenery should be designed as to avoid drivers and walkers from damaging the system, which can be achieved by using shrubs, flowering and soil-covering species. On the other hand, suitable plant species need to be adjusted to the local climate and should be perennial, easy to maintain and robust, including resilience against de-icing salt during winter time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has been designed as a scientific experiment whose performance parameters are currently continuously monitored in order to learn for future applications. The adaptation measure is particularly suited for the secondary street system in settlements and for newly developed settlement areas. With necessary modifications, the rainwater management system can be tailored to other situations, such as green roofs, car parks, and private housing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “eco-street” concept has received much attention by both the public and experts, and it is considered an important innovation in sustainable local road construction. The municipality Ober-Grafendorf intends to widely apply the concept on its territory, therewith reducing the share of sealed surface area.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was initiated by the Mayor of Ober-Grafendorf, who has long been a strong proponent of sustainable and environment-friendly solutions in municipal development. The decision to finance and install the adaptation measure has been taken by the municipal council. Since the measure was to be realized in a new urban area that was still undeveloped, there was no particular need to further involve residents in the decision. However, as it is required by the spatial planning laws in Austria, the preceding local spatial development plan and the concrete zoning plan have been subject to stakeholder participation and public consultation. Crucial contacts to external experts were brokered by the long-term gardening service provider of the municipality. On behalf of the municipality, the project has been implemented in cooperation with the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna and the consultancy firm Zenebio GmbH, who had already invested several years of research in developing smart rainwater management systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparation of the measure was embedded in a regional adaptation process that was conducted in the Mostviertel region in Lower Austria from 2011 to 2014. Running under the title “Changeable Mostviertel. Fit into climate future”, the process was one of the pilot activities within the Alpine Space project C3-Alps and aimed at supporting and implementing adaptation at local level. Building on a tailored regional communication strategy and careful planning of the process, the stakeholder process applied structured forms of participation and group interaction formats, supported by more informal ad hoc-interactions with stakeholders. Particular attention was given to early participation of stakeholders, the continuity and transparency of the process, and regular stakeholder interactions. A core team of the Climate Alliance Lower Austria, politically backed up by representatives of the Office of the Provincial Government Lower Austria, was responsible for designing, organising and steering the process on the regional level. Over a duration of three years from 2012 to 2014, seven municipalities, including Ober-Grafendorf, participated in four local workshops per municipality, totalling to 28 municipal workshops, plus four joint cross-municipal workshops and public stakeholder events. The main functions of the process management team were to motivate stakeholders to participate, to initiate and facilitate the local adaptation processes, to provide and broker scientific knowledge in usable forms, to integrate local knowledge, and to provide a supportive and empowering framework for the municipality stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main stakeholders involved were the mayors as well as the leaders and members of local working groups in each of the seven pilot municipalities. The work groups set up in each municipality were composed of a group of citizens of different ages, sexes, education and profession. The inter-municipal workshops and public events were highly appreciated by participants for facilitating exchange of experiences and social learning among the work groups of all municipalities. Preparation of adaptation knowledge as well as information transfer was supported by external climate change experts, who delivered expert lectures at the workshops on the specific topics chosen by each municipality. The regional adaptation process was embedded in wider networking activities with partner organisations and institutions with multiplier roles, including regional development agencies, managers of LEADER regions, the agency for village and city renewal of Lower Austria, the regional energy and environment agency of Lower Austria, and managers of climate and energy model regions.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Confirming the innovation potential of the project, the measure has won the Austrian Energy Globe Award in the category “water” and a Climate Star award in 2016. The adaptation solution has since then been tailored to different context situations and has been applied also in other municipalities and large cities, including Vienna. Success factors that facilitated the implementation of the measure include the following:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The municipality of Ober-Grafendorf has long-standing experiences in climate mitigation, energy efficiency and sustainable development activities. It has for years been an active member of respective networks and programmes, such as the Climate Alliance, the e5 Programme, the Climate and Energy Model Region “Mostviertel Mitte”, Fair Trade Municipalities, and, most recently, the Covenant of Mayors. Past experiences with local integration of environmental policy themes and active participation in municipality networks have contributed to paving the way for the entry of climate adaptation onto the municipal agenda.</li>
<li>As an ecosystem-based adaptation measure that responds to several climate change impacts at the same time and delivers multiple environmental co-benefits, the measure can be considered a good practice example of sustainable adaptation.</li>
<li>The measure performs very well as regards cost-effectiveness, and it has comparative cost advantages against conventional solutions. It thus saves public money and disburdens the municipal household.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the regional adaptation process conducted within the “seed-funding” C3-Alps project proved successful in raising awareness about climate change and adaptation needs, in communicating climate adaptation as well as in transferring adaptation knowledge and building adaptive capacities. It was thus the crucial trigger in putting climate adaptation on the agendas of the participating municipalities. Based on an evaluation of lessons learnt from the process in C3-Alps, the following success and facilitating factors have been identified:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>back-up by higher administrative levels and personal presence of representatives at stakeholder meetings demonstrated political commitment and motivated municipalities to participate;</li>
<li>bottom-up problem formulation and choice of the topics of interest by the municipalities themselves was crucial for commitment, acceptance and relevance of the developed adaptation measures;</li>
<li>framing adaptation to climate change in positive terms, by emphasizing opportunities and concepts such as resilience, sustainability and future development potentials, rather than in terms of risk, damage or loss, helped to communicate adaptation;</li>
<li>support for local adaptation processes needs to be responsive to the specificities of each municipality and to take into account the preferences of individual stakeholders; there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach that works equally well in each municipality;</li>
<li>in order to be well-performing, the participation process required intense preparation, careful planning, professional process management and sufficient resources (financing, time), while at the same time leaving sufficient room for flexibility;</li>
<li>preparation and communication of knowledge needs to be target group-oriented; internal communication trainings with a didactic expert helped to professionalise the communication approaches;</li>
<li>finding the right balance between motivating stakeholders to participate and avoiding overstraining of stakeholders’ resources and capacities was difficult, but crucial;</li>
<li>cooperating and networking with other organisations active in the region was crucial for the sustainability of the adaptation process;</li>
<li>participation as a pilot region in an EU project and “being a forerunner region” on transnational level were strong motivating arguments for the municipalities.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">As regards the entire regional adaptation process as such, the novelty of climate adaptation as a local policy theme in combination with the dominance and previously achieved depth of integration of climate mitigation and renewable energy issues at the local level proved to be the most limiting factor. Discriminating adaptation from mitigation was thus difficult to many municipal stakeholders. As a consequence, a part of the developed adaptation measures had a strong bias towards climate mitigation and were lacking the clear adaptation relevance. Another difficulty was that at the time of implementing the process a regional adaptation strategy at provincial level was still missing. The adaptation options set out in the National Action Plan on Adaptation to Climate Change proved to be ill-suited for the local level, i.e. they were perceived as too abstract, strategic and distant. Thus, considerable efforts had to be invested in “translating” and “down-scaling” adaptation options from the national to the local level.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In comparison to conventional structural solutions, the smart, ecological urban rainwater management system implemented in Ober-Grafendorf has considerable cost advantages, both over the short and the long term, and it delivers a range of environmental co-benefits. The environmental performance of the measure is currently being monitored. Quantitative data are gathered on, e.g., the water balance of the system, the micro-climatic effects of substrates and plants, their capacity to filter out pollutants, and on the contribution of the local system to rainwater management on the regional scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the dimension and the accessibility of the site, the absolute investment costs for implementing the eco-street / DrainGarden® concept can vary from case to case. The cost of the substrate for one cubic metre is about 100 Euros. Depending on the choice of plants, the cultivation cost ranges from two Euros / m<sup>2</sup> for seeding to several thousand Euros / m<sup>2 </sup>for planting large woody perennial plants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The measure avoids considerable investment costs that would otherwise be required for building road-side sewage pipes and for installing a clean water drain, and it reduces long-term operational costs for maintaining the sewerage, pumping out the sewers in case of flooding, treating wastewater as well as for irrigating and maintaining the urban greenery. Since the costs for constructing and maintaining the urban sewage and water sanitation system make up a high share of municipal budgets, this considerably reliefs burdens from urban households. The immediate cost for roadside construction works and street design differ only marginally from standard solutions, because the system is implemented in areas that would have been used for conventional roadside greenery anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to preventing the risk of local flooding, the water drainage and rainwater management system offers multiple benefits. It stores rainwater, makes it available to plants, filters out pollutants, and gives off residual water amounts to the groundwater. Evaporation of the water stored in the substrates and transpiration by plants creates a cooling effect, thus improving the urban micro-climate and helping to mitigate heat stress during summerly heat periods without any additional cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Realisation of the measure has been financed by the regular municipal budget. The municipality did not receive any particular public funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same applies for the measures that have been implemented in the other municipalities that participated in the regional adaptation process. While a budget of 65,000 Euros was available for the process management and support services within the EU co-funded C3-Alps project, the municipalities and other stakeholders did not receive any funding or remuneration for participating in the regional pilot process and for implementing concrete measures. However, the process managers provided consulting and advise on available financial incentives and financing opportunities within existing funding programs of the provincial state and the federal government. In general, the adaptation activities defined and implemented by the municipalities often were soft and low-cost measures, rather than technological solutions requiring substantial investments.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction and maintenance of the secondary road network in Austrian municipalities is within municipal competence and thus represents a statutory responsibility of local authorities. The ecological urban rainwater management system has to comply with the same regulations and standards as any other conventional solution, e.g. with regulations related to road safety or national norms for water infiltration engineering works. A specific goal in the present case study was to comply with rules of the Austrian Water and Waste Management Association (ÖWAV) related to the storage of 100-year heavy rainfall events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The specific system DrainGarden®, which has been implemented in the present case, is a registered trademark and thus subject to respective applicable protection rights. The system is marketed by the Austrian gardening and landscape planning company Zenebio GmbH.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The environment-friendly urban street design for decentralized ecological rainwater management in Ober-Grafendorf was implemented during several months in the summer of 2015. It is accompanied by a scientific monitoring phase scheduled for several years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As regards the entire regional adaptation process within the C3-Alps project, preparatory activities started at the beginning of 2011. Beginning with the first stakeholder workshop in autumn 2011, the operational phase of the process lasted until the end of 2014. Implementation of measures by the municipalities and the inter-municipal exchange are continuing after the end of the C3-Alps project.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Sand Motor – building with nature solution to improve coastal protection along Delfland coast (the Netherlands)]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sand Motor is a ‘mega-nourishment’ implemented in the Delfland Coast (North Sea coast of South Holland, The Netherlands) as innovative pilot project to test the upscaling of regular sand nourishment along the Dutch coast, carried out by Rijkswaterstaat (the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management Works). The regular program is aimed at preservation of the coastline and protection against flooding. The Sand Motor also has the purpose to create (temporarily) space for leisure activities and nature development, as well as acquiring better understanding of the behaviour of the coastal system. These multiple purposes make it an example of a Building with Nature (BwN) solution that uses natural processes to fulfil multi-functional purposes in coastal management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intervention involved a huge amount of sand extracted offshore and deposited along the coast in a single operation, to form a hook-shaped peninsula. By making use of natural processes to redistribute the sand over time, the Sand Motor is a buffer against sea level rise, also mitigating the impacts of storm surges and coastal flooding. The intervention equals the amount of regular sand nourishment in the region for twenty years. This implies that, except for possible exceptional situations, during this period, and probably even longer, no additional nourishment is needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first complete assessment of how this solution has been working was formulated in 2016, after the first four years of monitoring, indicating success in coastal protection, particularly in the vicinity of the Sand Motor. New habitat for local flora and fauna was created and a new large sand shoal is offering new opportunities for recreational activities, meeting the initial expectations.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Netherlands, with its 350 km long coastline, nine million residents living in the coastal areas and vast regions located below the mean sea level, is severely exposed to the risk of coastal flooding. The experienced erosion of the coast, caused both by natural processes and by human interventions, carried out in the catchment area in the last centuries, is exacerbated by the current and predicted increase of sea level rise. A regional sea level rise of 0.65 to 1.3 m by 2100, and of 2 to 4 m by 2200, including the effect of land subsidence, should be taken into account according to the <a href="http://www.deltacommissie.com/doc/deltareport_full.pdf">Delta Committee</a><span>,</span> when making decisions with a long lasting impact for protection against flooding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the 90s, to face the issue of coastal erosion, Rijkswaterstaat started regular sand nourishment interventions. As an operational objective it was decided to preserve the coastline at its position (the reference is the situation of the year 1990). The annual volume of sand nourishment is set in policy documents at 12 million m<sup>3</sup>. This is the amount needed to preserve the entire Dutch coastal foundation (the area between dunes and the –20 m depth at sea), taking into account the sea-level rise rate that occurred in the last century (18 cm/century). It is expected that this volume could increase in the coming decades due to the projected more consistent sea level rise. Traditional sand nourishment operations (by depositing sand on the beach) were progressively supplemented by underwater nourishment on the foreshore, a much cheaper approach letting natural forces redistribute the sand and reducing impacts on coastal functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to investigate an even more efficient way of maintaining the coast, ideas of a 'mega-nourishment' emerged since 2006. Ideas for coastal expansion on the Delfland coast were already suggested since the 1970’s and got a strong impulse in the early 2000s by the Province of South Holland. A plan survey started in 2009, focused on a deposit of a huge volume of sand in a single operation, allowing that wind, waves and currents progressively spread the sand along the coast over a longer period of time compared to traditional nourishment initiatives.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the Dutch national coastal policy is the sustainable maintenance of the coastal zone on different scales of time and space:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Protection of the hinterland against flooding from sea, by maintaining safe water defences;</li>
<li>Maintaining the coastline (with the base coastline as the reference), preserving all coastal functions;</li>
<li>Maintenance of the coastal foundation in the context of relative sea level rise, meaning preserving the equilibrium between the mean sea level and the sediment budgets.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">As described in the <a href="https://www.dezandmotor.nl/uploads/2016/09/monitoring-and-evaluation-report-sand-motor-eng.pdf">report</a> about the first four years of the Monitoring and Evaluation Programme the following three objectives were formulated for the Sand Motor:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Encouragement of natural dune growth and preservation of a wide beach along the Delfland Coast between Hook of Holland and Scheveningen. This will provide coastal protection functions as well as benefits for nature conservation and leisure activities.</li>
<li>Knowledge development and innovation with the aim of determining the extent to which coastline maintenance and added value for leisure and nature can be achieved in conjunction, also in the perspective of sea level rise.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Creation of an appealing leisure and nature area on the Delfland Coast.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of ‘mega-nourishment’, as a long-lasting source of sand, deposited in a single operation, has been implemented through the Sand Motor pilot project, carried out in the Delfland coast (South Holland), where regular nourishment interventions have been carried out since 1990s to contrast coastal erosion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sand Motor is an innovative intervention to protect low-lying coastal zone from sea level rise impacts. It is a large nourishment performed in 2011, immediately after a general reinforcement of the Delfland coastal area. It involved 21.5 million cubic metres of sand extracted ten kilometres offshore and deposited along the coast, to form a hook-shaped peninsula of 128 ha, including a dune lake and a lagoon. The intervention was complemented with two foreshore nourishment operations conducted on either side of the peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ‘mega-nourishment’ follows the Building with Nature approach. The amount of deposited sand acts as a buffer against sea level rise. The approach reduces the frequency of disturbances of local ecosystems caused by regular sand nourishment interventions, while also providing new areas for nature and new opportunity for recreational activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its original shape, the Sand Motor protruded 1 km into the sea and stretched along 2 km of coast. At many locations it rises up to 5 meters above mean sea level. The final design of the Sand Motor was selected as the most compliant with the three main objectives set up in the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out for the project realisation: dune growth, creation of more nature and leisure facilities, knowledge development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the construction of the Sand Motor in 2011, the sand has indeed spread along the coast, with coastal accretion both to the south and the north. This led and still leads to changes in the shape of the Sand Motor, with (logically) the strongest evolution in the first year after construction. Transitory developments of the Sand Motor created new morphological shapes and landscapes: a ‘sand spit’, a lagoon, a tidal channel, the beach plain on the southern side of the Sand Motor, and different patterns of sand banks. Moreover, a new dune lake, with drainage and monitoring system, was created at the base of the hook ensuring that the Sand Motor will not have a negative impact on the groundwater flows in the Solleveld drinking water catchment area on the landward side.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sand Motor was realised after an agreement signed by the Province of South Holland, Rijkswaterstaat, the City of Hague, the Municipal Authorities of Westland, the Delfland District Water Control Board and the South Holland Environmental Federation. The project was co-designed by the signatories throughout workshops and its location was commonly decided to avoid any negative impact on the stakeholders engaged. Beyond the parties participating to the agreement, civil society was also consulted and had the possibility to ask questions and formally object through legal procedures, especially during the planning phase.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the sand Motor Initiative, long-term protection of the coast (primary objective) is combined with nature expansion (new habitat for local flora and fauna) and new space for recreation, meeting multiple targets of different actors. This created considerable national and international interest in the Sand Motor. Ecoshape, a joint effort involving Dutch dredging and engineering companies, the knowledge sector and the government, has contributed to spread and promote the Sand Motor initiative, highlighting its 'Building with Nature' approach. Alongside with the Sand Motor several research programs were set up, including NatureCoast, with three post-doctorate and twelve doctorate researchers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sand Motor-like solutions are being considered in several locations outside the Netherlands both in Europe (e.g., Sweden, United Kingdom, Belgium) and elsewhere (United States, Mexico). The realisation of the intervention required the use of an important volume of sand extracted offshore (21.5 million cubic metres) with a grain size that was sufficiently compatible with the characteristics of the beach area of deposit. Sand availability is an issue to be considered in the transferability of the practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sand Motor is a unique coastal area including sand flats that are submerged twice a day at high tide. Side-effects of the intervention were the creation of new currents resulting from the dynamic nature and changing form of the hook-shaped peninsula, creating temporary dangerous situations, especially for bathing. These could be kept under control by a combination of information to the public, extra attention of coastal guards which were assisted by bathymetric surveys and by a smartphone application.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was funded by the Province of South Holland and Rijkswaterstaat; the cost of the intervention was 70 million euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the intervention, an intense monitoring effort has been realised. Five years after the construction of the Sand Motor, the results of monitoring activities show its contribution to coastal protection, especially in the vicinity of the Sand Motor. The coastline at the Sand Motor and immediately to the north and south has moved and is now located seaward of the base coastline. Extensive research carried so far demonstrated that the new sand shoal created through the Sand Motor, offers new habitat for flora and fauna, especially in and around the sheltered and shallow part of the lagoon. Moreover, the Sand Motor is offering a new large area which is used for recreational purposes, in line with the expectation of the Provincial Authority of South Holland. Other benefits relate to the acquired knowledge on the coastal system and the possibilities to implement this innovative intervention for strengthening the coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The projected long lifetime of the Sand Motor (about 20 years) is a clear advantage of the intervention compared to traditional sand nourishment requiring regular interventions with large volume of sand frequently disturbing the seabed. Five years after the intervention, Sand Motor is considered a realistic alternative for coastal management in terms of both costs and effect. A complete economic evaluation of the innovative intervention compared to conventional maintenance solutions has not yet formulated.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2008, a new Delta Committee (after the first one established to manage the disastrous flood of 1953) was commissioned by the Dutch Secretary of Public Works and Water Management, with the mandate of formulating a vision on the long-term protection of the Dutch coast and its hinterland. This second State Delta Committee provided suggestions on how to protect the Dutch coast and the low-lying hinterland against the expected impacts of climate change, including sea level rise and coastal flooding. These recommendations, in an integrated vision for the future extending to 2100, fed the <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/metadata/publications/delta-act-and-delta-programme-the-netherlands">Delta Programme</a> for a climate-proof Netherlands, further embedded in the Delta Act. Building with nature approach, with sand nourishment to protect North Sea coastal areas from flooding is part of the recommendations of the Delta Committee to be followed in the medium and long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The planning phase of Sand Motor included the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure, to identify the most feasible and environmentally friendly alternatives for nourishment-based coastal management.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Implementation of the Vitoria-Gasteiz Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy was launched by the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz in 2012. Its main objectives are the regeneration of degraded areas through eco-design techniques, the enhancement of urban biodiversity, the improvement of connectivity and functionality of different urban and periurban green areas, the promotion of public use of green space and the improvement of adaptation capacity to climate change, as in particular more severe and frequent heatwaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of the strategy included the refurbishment of the Gasteiz Avenue with eco-design techniques and the creation of a green facade in the Congress Palace Europa, located on the same road axis. At the same time, interventions have begun in the neighborhoods in order to regenerate green areas and free spaces; a first initiative has been implemented in the Lakua area (Lakuabizkarra in Basque), also with the aim to test the performance of different techniques to be then exported in other similar areas.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main climate change challenges for Vitoria-Gasteiz are changes in precipitation pattern, increase in temperature and increase in the risk of flooding. Changes in precipitation are especially expected in spring time with an average decrease ranging between 10% and 30% by 2100. It is also expected an increase up to 30% in the number of events with extreme precipitation. Studies also project an increased risk and danger of flooding. It is also expected an increase in average annual temperature and in the occurrence of heatwaves. Specifically, during winter months minimum temperatures could rise between 1 and 3ºC by 2100, while during summer months projections show a possible increase up to 3ºC in maximum temperatures still by 2100. Due to these changes, longer and more recurrent heatwaves are expected by the end of the century.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vitoria-Gasteiz is a city of more than 200,000 inhabitants, which might be affected by more severe climatic conditions. For this reason, it is extremely important to create green areas that can reduce the heatwaves impacts and heat island effect typical of urban areas. Green areas will also promote the conservation, connectivity and improvement of biodiversity, relevant for both mitigation and adaptation to climate change.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy was launched by the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz in 2012 and has also implied the “Roots of Tomorrow” project, which is still on-going. The strategy aims to explore the usefulness of different green urban infrastructure solutions to address diverse urban challenges such as improving biodiversity, mitigating climate change and promoting climate change adaptation in the city. It also involves the study of urban ecosystem services, the concept of multi-functionality of green urban infrastructure and its associated benefits. Based on this general aim, the Vitoria-Gasteiz Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy pursues the following specific objectives:</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Improve the biodiversity in the city, increasing the spatial and functional connectivity between the urban and periurban green areas.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase the services provided by the urban ecosystems, strengthening natural processes.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Integrate ecological and hydrological processes and flows in urban planning.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce the urban heat island effect, reducing climate change impact and improving adaptation in the city.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Promote the public use of green spaces, increase leisure and recreational opportunities, increase accessibility and field-city connections, preserve cultural heritage and traditional landscapes and extend the sense of identity and belonging.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Create an urban environment that favors the health, well-being and the general habitability of the city.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Raise awareness on the relationship between nature-biodiversity and society and, in particular, on goods and services provided by ecosystems, including their economic valuation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Contribute to economic development through job creation.</li>
</ol>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Being aware that it is necessary to develop new strategies and intervention projects that transform the city into a space that reconnects with nature and becomes more resilient, the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz proposed in 2012 a new line of action based on the application of the green urban infrastructure concept. For this purpose, the City Council developed the Vitoria-Gasteiz Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy. This strategy relates to other municipal plans such as the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and the Plan to combat and adapt to climate change, which highlights the necessity of creating green spaces to mitigate city’s contribution to climate change, as well as creating green infrastructures to increase city’s resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy is being implemented through various interventions in different parts of the city: the Green Ring (a series of parks and semi-rural areas surrounding the city), the urban parks and the ecological corridors connecting different elements (such as trees along water streams or tree lined streets), vacant plots and even buildings. Interventions are very diverse and in many cases multi-objective, including:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Transformation of vacant plots into new green spaces;</li>
<li>Increase of biomass and number of trees and shrubs in parks and gardens.</li>
<li>Enhancement of habitat functions in existing green areas through interventions that increase urban biodiversity, improve the conservation of native species and improve water management.</li>
<li>Promotion of ecological agriculture in free and periurban spaces.</li>
<li>Promotion of green in facades and covers, etc.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the most emblematic interventions that have been already carried out in the framework of the Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy include the urban renovation of the Gasteiz Avenue with eco-design techniques and, related to it, the creation of a green facade in the Congress Palace Europa, located on the same road axis. Refurbishment of the Gasteiz Avenue consisted basically in the construction of a restored river corridor, the plantation of aligned trees along the new channel and the construction of car-free streets. The installation of a vertical garden on the Congress Palace Europa facade made up of native species has contributed to the improvement of the thermal and acoustic insulation of the building, the reduction of air pollution and the enhancement of the aesthetic quality of the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, interventions have begun in different neighborhoods with the aim of addressing and responding jointly to a series of problems related to urban management. These interventions take place in current vacant and green areas, such as empty plots and parks. A first initiative of naturalization of green spaces and vacant plots has been implemented in Lakuabizkarra neighborhood through the Lakua neighborhood project. This area has been selected as a pilot space to test different interventions in terms of performances in order to be able to replicate them in other areas of the city, such as Zabalgana and Salburua, which have very similar characteristics to Lakua area. With the aim of improving the ecological and environmental functionality of existing green spaces and vacant plots, as well as reducing the costs currently incurred in their management and maintenance, up to now the project has intervened in 50 different spaces through various kinds of naturalization actions. The benefits of these actions are an improved water management system that reduce flood risk, reduction of air pollution, improvement of temperature regulation that reduce heat-island effect, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Roots of Tomorrow” project will continue until 2020. Besides, the municipality of Vitoria-Gasteiz has signed an agreement with the Basque Water Agency (URA) to develop various kinds of interventions with the aim of reducing the impacts of flooding events in the city. These projects will be carried out until 2020 and will be funded by the Basque Government.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A participation process was carried out during the design phase of the strategy, as well as during its implementation. Moreover, citizens and other private stakeholders were highly involved in the “Roots of Tomorrow” project with the aim of promoting their commitment towards the project goals. They were engaged during the design of the project, as well as through specific project actions, such as tree-planting days, involving more than 2,500 people, and awareness campaigns, including participation of more than 3,000 students. Besides collaborating through the above mentioned actions, private stakeholders could also participate by financing part of the interventions included in the “Roots of Tomorrow” project.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The involvement of citizens and local private sector stakeholders have been considered to be a success factor, as they have helped to create a consensus on the needs as well as the benefits of the implementation of the Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall strategy provides an overarching frame for the design and implementation of other specific interventions, that therefore can contribute to the same goals. As planned interventions have multi-objectives, they produce co-benefits beyond climate change adaptation<span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interventions tested in Lakuabizkarra neighborhood has enabled assessing the performance of different modalities of actions and exporting most suitable approaches to other neighborhoods.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The budget allocated for the refurbishment of Gasteiz Avenue and the construction of the green facade in the Congress Palace Europa amounted to 10 million Euros. The investment made for Green Ring project reached 2 million Euros over the four years of implementation. The investment made for Lakuabizkarra area reached 415.000 Euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy has been developed to enhance urban biodiversity, as well as improve the connectivity and functionality of the different urban and peri-urban green spaces. Concerning climate change adaptation, such interventions contribute reducing the heat island effect and help regulating the local climate. Moreover, an increase in the public use of green spaces and the opportunities of leisure and recreation can be expected. Finally, it is expected that some concrete measures such as the green facade of the Congress Palacio Europa will result in lower energy consumption in the building, as well as better regulation of the temperature in its interior and nearer surroundings.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The normative and legal framework in which the Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy lays upon, is the General Plan of Urban Planning, currently under review. Moreover, this strategy shares objectives with other municipal strategies and plans, as in particular the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy of the municipality of Vitoria-Gasteiz elaborated in May 2011. The main objective of the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy is to stop the loss of biodiversity and to achieve a favorable state of conservation of habitats and species within the municipality, promoting the recognition of its values and functions for society. The Action Plan of the biodiversity strategy refers to the importance of drafting a Green Infrastructure Plan specifically for the urban area, establishing the necessary actions to conserve or promote its biodiversity and ensure its multi-functionality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other plans directly related to the Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy are the Plan to combat and adapt to climate change, including a number of measures that can be developed through the implementation of the strategy on green urban infrastructure. In addition, the Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy show synergies also with the Plan for Sustainable Mobility and Public Space and the Municipal Health Plan.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy was launched in 2012 and its implementation started shortly after. In the following years it focused on the renovation of the Gasteiz Avenue through eco-design techniques, that was completed in 2014, as well as on the green facade of the Congress Palace Europa that was constructed between 2014 and 1015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interventions on the neighborhoods, as part of the same Green Urban Infrastructure Strategy, are currently being implemented. The intervention in Lakuabizara neighborhood were initiated in 2015 and finalized in 2016 through the project for the naturalization of green spaces and vacant plots. This enabled testing performances of different interventions to be exported in other neighborhoods and spaces of the city, such as the new neighborhoods of Zabalgana and Salburua.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Stuttgart: combating the heat island effect and poor air quality with green ventilation corridors]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stuttgart’s location in a valley basin, its mild climate, low wind speeds, industrial activity and high volume of traffic has made it susceptible to poor air quality. Development on the valley slopes has prevented air from moving through the city, which worsens the air quality and contributes to the urban heat island effect. A Climate Atlas was developed for the Stuttgart region, presenting the distribution of temperature and cold air flows according to the city’s topography and land use. Based on this information, a number of planning and zoning regulations are recommended that also aim to preserve and increase open space in densely built-up areas.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">The city's location has a significant influence on its local climate including implications for solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind. Stuttgart sits in the wide Neckar basin formed by two river valleys, shielded by steep hill slopes. Stuttgart's centre is located at about 240m above sea level, while the surrounding hills rise to 500m a.s.l.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">Stuttgart has a mild, temperate climate with warm summers. Wind speeds throughout the city are generally low, which along with the urban heat island effect, contributes to poor air quality. The future climate projections for 2071-2100 suggest a 2ºC increase of mean annual temperature in Stuttgart. The projections for heat waves (T&#62;30°C) suggest that the number of days with heat stress (when people’s thermoregulation is impaired) will increase significantly. By 2100, 57% of the Greater Stuttgart region could have more than 30 days with heat stress (in the low lying areas over 60 days). Therefore, a significantly higher percentage of people are likely to be exposed to the risks associated with heat waves than at present.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary objective for the region of Stuttgart is to facilitate air exchange in the city, thereby enhancing the potential for cool air flow from the hills towards the urban areas on the valley floor.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">The Climate Atlas for the region of Stuttgart was published in 2008, based on the previous work in this area carried out by the City of Stuttgart since the 1980s and the in-house urban climatology department (in existence in the City of Stuttgart since 1938). The Climate Atlas provides standardised climatic assessments for the 179 towns and municipalities in the Stuttgart region. The Atlas comprises maps which show regional wind patterns, flows of cold air, air pollution concentrations, and other relevant information required to inform planners on what to do for urban climatic optimization that could inform new projects and retrofits. A key element of the Atlas is an area classification based on the role that different locations play in air exchange and cool airflow in the Stuttgart region, based on topography, development density and character, and provision of green space. The Atlas distinguishes eight categories of areas in this manner, and for each of them different planning measures and recommendations are provided.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">In addition to responding to local climate characteristics, the following principles form the basis for the planning recommendations included in the “Climate Booklet for Urban Development Online – Städtebauliche Klimafibel Online”:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Vegetation should be placed to surround developments and larger, connected green spaces should be created or maintained throughout developed areas to facilitate air exchange;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Valleys serve as air delivery corridors and should not be developed;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Hillsides should remain undeveloped, especially when development exists in valleys, since intensive cold- and fresh-air transport occurs here;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Saddle-like topographies serve as air induction corridors and should not be developed;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Urban sprawl is to be avoided;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">All trees growing in the urban core with a trunk circumference of more than 80 cm at height of 1m are protected with a tree preservation order.</div>
</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of the recommendations in the Climate Atlas is carried out by the Office for Urban Planning and Urban Renewal, supported by the Office for Environmental Protection. The Section of Urban Climatology within the Office for Environmental Protection evaluates the climatic implications of intended development and larger buildings. As a result of the implementation of the recommendations included in the Climate Atlas and Climate Booklet, over 39% of Stuttgart’s surface area has been put under the protection of nature conservation orders; a record in Germany. As a result of greening actions, greenery covers more than 60% of the city. Stuttgart contains 5,000 hectares of forests and woodland, 65,000 trees in parks and open spaces and 35,000 street trees. 300,000 square meters of rooftops have been greened and 40 out of 250 kilometres of tram tracks have been grassed (as of 2007). In line with the city development vision, 60 hectares of greenfield land previously earmarked for development has been cut from the 2010 land development plan to protect existing green space. Targeted interventions such as a building ban in the hills around the town, and prevention of building projects that might obstruct the ventilation effect of nocturnal cold-air flows have resulted in preservation and enhancement of air exchange and cool air flows in the city.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">The Climate Atlas 2008 was developed in close collaboration between the Verband Region Stuttgart (the association of regional cities and municipalities) and the City of Stuttgart. The Section of Urban Climatology within the Office for Environmental Protection of the City of Stuttgart contributed with its specialist knowledge. The evaluation and processing of the data for drawing up of the basic material required to produce the maps were undertaken by an external specialist consultant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">The City of Stuttgart emphasises the importance of public participation in greening strategies aimed at improving air quality and mitigation of the heat island effect. This is achieved through different strategies:</p>
<ul><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">Since 1986, the City of Stuttgart has provided financial support to green about 60,000 square meters of roofs.</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">Since 1992, a scheme has been in place for Stuttgart residents to adopt a tree. Today some 182 caretakers have adopted almost 500 trees. They are responsible for watering the tree, reporting pest attacks, removing the leaf litter and fallen branches, and protecting the tree from dog fouling.</div>
</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The Mayor of the City of Stuttgart supports the city greening initiatives aimed at improving air quality and reducing temperatures. The land use plan 2010 for Stuttgart envisages urban development under the slogan “urban – compact – green”. Climate change adaptation and mitigation are both high on the political agenda locally. The city has had a climate change mitigation strategy since 1997 and a climate change adaptation strategy was developed in 2012.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">The preservation of natural environment in urban areas is principally guided by the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG) and by the Nature Conservation Act of the Land of Baden-Württemberg (NatSchG). The Federal Nature Conservation Act prohibits the modification or impairment of protected green spaces, or changing land use in these protected areas. Protected green spaces comprise: green zones in settlement areas, parks, cemeteries, significant gardens, single trees, lines of trees, avenues or groves in settled or under developed areas; and some plantings and protective wooded areas outside forests. Preserving the history and culture of the region can also be a reason for protecting green spaces.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">German Building Code from 1960 is an important influence over urban development. The regulations were revised in 2004, and now require precautionary environmental protection in urban zoning and planning practices. § 1 (5) states that urban development planning has to be sustainable, integrating social, economic and ecological demands, and also assuming responsibility for future generations. Urban development plans must contribute to the creation of an environment that is fit for human beings, that protects natural resources, that contributes to climate protection, as well as preserving and developing the urban pattern and appearance of the landscape of towns and cities. According to § 1 (6) the following aspects have to be taken into account (amongst others) when establishing urban development plans: the presentation of landscape plans and green open space structure plans, as well as other plans concerning issues such as water rights, waste rights and pollution control rights; and the conservation of the best possible air quality.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Autonomous adaptation to droughts in an agro-silvo-pastoral system in Alentejo]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Herdade do Freixo do Meio is an organic certified farm of 440 hectares located in the Alentejo region in the south of Portugal, a region characterized by the multifunctional agro-silvo-pastoral system of cork and holm oak trees, named <em>montado</em>. This farm employs about 20 people and produces cork, vegetables, fruit, wine and herbs, and holds animals (such as sheep, cows, pig, turkey and chicken) extensively. This farm has been implementing various sustainable agriculture techniques while keeping the farm economically viable and at the same time raising awareness about sustainable farming practices. The farm is also a case study for autonomous adaptation to climate change since, without top-down specific incentives, it has implemented adaptation measures to deal with a changing climate (and especially increased drought intensity and frequency) such as crop diversification and water conservation and retention measures.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The region of Alentejo, in Portugal, is characterized by a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. It is generally classified as an area of high vulnerability to climate change and high risk of desertification due to its aridity index and extension of low quality soils, combined with the climate scenarios that project for this region decrease in precipitation, increase in the frequency, duration and intensity of droughts and increase in temperatures. It is a region with a low density of population (some districts have less than 8 inhabitant/km<sup>2</sup>) and, despite being a region of agriculture and forestry, the majority of its area has no irrigation infrastructures; some areas have received investments to develop such infrastructures as in the case of the Alqueva dam. The land is typically used for rain fed agriculture of cereals and forage, grazing or agroforestry, with the cork oak and holm oak as primary trees. Herdade do Freixo do Meio is an organic certified farm located near the town of Montemor-o-novo, a municipality characterised by vast areas used for cork and holm oak <em>montado</em>, a multifunctional agro-silvo-pastoral system without irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adapting to climate change in the region of Alentejo faces very different challenges depending on whether agriculture is supported by irrigation infrastructures or not. In majority of the areas where irrigation does not exist, the main challenge will be to deal with the decreased precipitation, increased droughts and increased temperatures. In the Alentejo region, according to RCP8.5 scenario annual precipitation is expected to decrease, of about 18%, from the present 631 mm to 519 mm in year 2100. In some municipalities such as Mértola, the precipitation is expected to decrease from present 482 mm to 288 mm in 2100. With this reduction of rainfall, pastures, cereals and forage are expected to become less productive and become less economically viable. Already in the present whenever a drought with 6-12 months of duration occurs, the cereal or forage crops are affected with sometimes 100% loss. Additionally, trees mortality is expected to rise due to increase fires and diseases occurrence, reducing their productivity as up to 50-100% for some species (e.g. eucalyptus and cork oak).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures such as protecting the territory and the forests against fire may have high costs. As productivity decreases and competition with European and global agro markets increases, the margin of profit of farmers decreases, often reaching loss net values already in the present. Financing of adaptation measures at the farm level is therefore a major obstacle. In the region many farms of 200-600 hectares of <em>montado</em> employ only two people; small farms are almost impossible to manage without loss, which has contributed to land abandonment. The main products of these farms are normally cork and sheep or cattle. The grain and forage produced without irrigation is no longer economically viable except integrated with animal production. Crop diversification, is also a big challenge, first due to water scarcity and secondly due to the low density of population and difficulty of commercialization. Cork trees are typically the main added value product of this type of farm but this has a fluctuant price. Moreover, cork oaks are now subject to more and more diseases (e.g. the fungus <em>p. cinammomi</em>) and in climate change scenarios are projected to decrease their productivity by 50%.</p>

    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 1990, Herdade do Freixo do Meio farm has been implementing a production model aiming to restoration of soil and diversification of its uses, in particular maintaining forest, bush and grass and at the same time enabling sustainable economic activities as: production of animals, fruits, vegetables; transformation of products; renewable energy generation, tourism, restoration and research. The measures implemented by the Herdade do Freixo do Meio aim to reduce its water needs, reduce desertification and soil erosion, and increase resilience to climate change and climate extremes, while sustaining an economically viable agro-forestry system.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The farm has implemented a wide number of measures aiming at reducing water needs, increasing resilience to droughts, diversifying crop products and increasing awareness on sustainability and climate change adaptation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Measures to improve water retention and reduce water needs:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Creation of small dams;</li>
<li>Drip irrigation (to reduce water consumption) with organic fertilizer (farmer-made organic liquid fertilizer rich in bacteria introduced in drip irrigation);</li>
<li>Use of renewable energy for water pumping to reduce irrigation costs;</li>
<li>Mulch, i.e., use of straw, leaves, shredded wood, other natural fibre or even compost to cover soil and prevent evaporation;</li>
<li>Tilling on contour line and no tilling in steep areas, aiming to prevent soil erosion and increase soil’s water retention;</li>
<li>Keyline design of terrain, trees and crops. This practice increases water infiltration and water soil retention, preventing erosion, increasing pastures productivity and water availability in a larger area and increasing the depth of roots and carbon sink;</li>
<li>Increasing organic matter of soil to improve soil’s water retention;</li>
<li>Preparation of terrain with swales and boomerang shapes to increase soil’s water retention;</li>
<li>Planting trees and crops in areas with particular microclimates within the farm (e.g. northwest slopes have higher levels of humidity).</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Agroforestry and crop diversification measures (i.e. measures that increase the resilience, efficiency and productivity of the farm in moments of reduced production and forage due to drought and water scarcity):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Maintaining or creating the traditional <em>montado</em> multifunctional landscape, i.e. cork oak or holm oak trees combined with pastures and grazing sheep, goat, pig or cow as well as cereal or forage agriculture;</li>
<li>Diversification of crops and using autochthone animal breeds (e.g. introducing turkey as a pastoral species in the agroforestry system);</li>
<li>Supporting the commercialisation of the diversification of products through CSA – Community Supported Agriculture.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Diversification is considered one of the main a strategies to adapt to agroforestry systems to climate change and uncertainty of seasonal patterns. However, one of main challenges for the farmer is then to compete in the international markets based on price, since marginal costs are higher for diversified, seasonal products. This farm has 34 horticulture products, 5 species of animals (cow, pig, lamb, goat, turkey), olive oil, honey, mushrooms, wine, transformed products, etc. While this diversification brings climate resilience, the marketing is hardly done through conventional channels. Establishing a CSA and a direct link and trust relationship with consumers is a strategy that has been implemented with success by this farm. Different types of box schemes have been experimented and are being implemented. These schemes consist of delivering boxes with different products adapted to the consumers’ needs (e.g. vegetables, meat, etc.) directly to the consumers’ doors. One particular scheme that strongly supports the farm is the establishment of a group of consumers that sign a three month contract in advance to receive a weekly box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This scheme also includes awareness raising events, visits and courses organised at the farm, in particular:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Awareness raising campaigns developed by the farm contribute not only to improve consumers loyalty, but also to create a larger pool of consumers that support sustainable climate adapted farms as well as to inspire other farmers to adopt climate adaptation solutions.:</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Training courses on: ecological management of <em>montado</em> ecosystem, permaculture (Permanent Agriculture) design and ecological landscape design (i.e., landscape design methods and approaches that are based in working with nature and its patterns, thus reducing the need for external input and therefore increasing the efficiency of the agricultural system, which is important in case of increasing pressure of climate variables);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Visits to the farm and on-farm courses to raise awareness on environmental friendly management of organic, permaculture and agro-ecological farming.</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main stakeholders of the farm are its workers, neighbours and consumers. Stakeholders participation is relevant to achieve a more effective and lasting adaptation to climate changes. As mentioned above, involving consumers is essential to be able to market the farm diversity and pay for the added ecosystem services provided by the farm (organic farming, reduced pollution, increased biodiversity etc.). Consumers are directly involved in the farm life and to some extent influence the farm production by joining the Community Supported Agriculture scheme that involves both farmers and consumers together in contracts of three months in advance of consumption of farm products. Consumers that embrace this scheme are called co-producers and have a closer relation to the farm having the possibility to visit the farm, provide suggestions and be involved in other participation events. More in general, the farm is open for tourist visits and courses many times throughout the year. Two smaller areas inside the farm are being used with free 50 year contracts by young farmers initiating their organic farm projects.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main general barriers to climate change adaptation for Herdade do Freixo do Meio were identified through questionnaires and interviews; i.e.:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Policy and agriculture regulations and bureaucracy (e.g. it is very difficult to have permission to build a dam or off-stream water catchment);</li>
<li>Lack of information about climate adaptation measures and methods;</li>
<li>Present economic situation of Portugal;</li>
<li>Availability of and access to new technologies.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">A relevant factor determinant for the success of the Herdade do Freixo do Meio is the innovative approach used by the farm to reach a market niche that is growing in Portugal, looking for ecological, organic and responsible farm production. Another relevant factor is the motivation, knowledge and human capacities of the owner, Alfredo Sendim, the main promoter and keeper of the vision for the farm. His knowledge of agro-ecology combined with more expert knowledge of consultants and workers on agro-ecology and permaculture have played a key role in the success of the farm and its approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that many of the adaptation measures were implemented autonomously without subsidies or incentives specifically focusing on climate change adaptation and sustainable development is mostly due to the motivation mentioned above but also to the financial capacity of the farm. Nevertheless this farm has been able to use and benefit from some general farm subsidies to reach some of its vision and goals.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A proper cost-benefit analysis of climate change adaptation measures was not done as it is difficult to isolate these measures from the overall set of implemented actions aiming in general to more sustainable production; climate change adaptation interventions have not been separated in the farm yearly financial reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Herdade do Freixo do Meio yearly net income is about 500.000 € and about 40% of this value is from European Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) subsidies, namely in basic payment scheme and agro-Environmental measures. The farm employs 22 full-time workers and 4 seasonal workers, also involving an average of six permanent (rotating) volunteers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The economic benefits of the implemented measures can be seen especially when compared to neighbouring farms and in regions with the same conditions. Typically farms with 400 ha of <em>montado</em> without irrigation facilities employ 1 to 5 workers. Herdade do Freixo do Meio employs 4 times more people which is a good indicator of employment promotion. Further, some of the neighbouring farms have gone bankrupt due to big financial investments and loss in global market competition. Diversification of products (over 150 different agro-silvo-pastoral products) has guaranteed an increased resilience to extreme events such as droughts as well as to potential fluctuations in market prices. The landscape mosaics created also promote benefits for biodiversity preservation and sustainable tourism.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Herdade do Freixo do Meio is a limited company with one owner. Furthermore there are some parts of the land with free-leased agreements for young farmers to implement organic farming and innovative adaptation measures such as keyline design.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Implementation of sustainable and climate change adaptation measures is considered a continuous practice and is not limited in time. Some measures are very fast to implement (e.g. mulching, takes minutes for each tree/plant), while others take decades (e.g. establishing a cork oak multifunctional forest takes 40 years to become profitable).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Room for the River Regge, Netherlands - restoring dynamics]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Regge River is a typical rain fed river. Starting in the 19th century the first bends were cut and over the years the Regge River was largely turned into a canal. In situations with heavy rainfall, large areas in the valley of the river are flooded. In dry periods, on the contrary, agriculture and the wetlands suffer from the lack of water. Because of climate change, precipitation is projected to become more extreme; showers heavier and dry spells more prolonged. Measures directed at restoring the dynamics of the river must also help to adapt to these projected changes.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[room for the river, re-meandering, integrated approach, nature development, water retention]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Until 1848, the Regge River was quite a meandering river. Starting in the 19th century the first bends were cut and over the years the Regge River was largely turned into a canal. Under flooding conditions, large areas in the valley of the Regge River are flooded and in some places the floods are a mile wide. In severe drought situations, however, the river is no more than a coherent set of stationary eddies. Nowadays, the main stream regularly cuts off meanders, but these are still recognizable in the landscape today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With climate change the precipitation patterns are projected to change: more rain is expected to fall in shorter periods of time, increasing the risk of floods, while dry periods are expected to become longer and hotter, increasing the need for water retention for nature and agriculture. With the current river structure, such precipitation patterns will lead to severe problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the rivers’ restricted structure, the Regge is still important for small-scale nature and the cultural landscape. The Water Board Regge and Dinkel (successively merged into the Water Board Vechtstromen) is committed, together with the province of Overijssel, relevant municipalities, landowners and various interest groups, to gradually transform some 50 km of the river into a natural river. The ‘climate buffer’ Regge will provide more space to store the water in periods of flooding by re-meandering. This transformation will also increase the sponge effect of the soil, preserving more water for dry periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, the Regge faces extreme peak discharges and has inadequate basic drainage, while the region faces desiccation of nature and drought damage to agriculture in the summer season. The stream was ‘sandwiched’ between maintenance paths and water retaining embankments. This provided little room for the necessary restoration of the dynamics of the river. Moreover, the quality of the water and its sediments was moderate to poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all, the river forms a landscape that provides insufficient basis for a scenic and ecologically well-functioning of the Regge basin. The challenge of the transformation programme, which includes several  projects, was to turn the catchment into a string of beads of habitats for plants and animals, and a beautiful 'backdrop' for tourists and holidaymakers to cross by bicycle, boat or on foot or to spend a few days. The aspirations of farmers to broaden their businesses are also connected with this programme.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall objective is to make the Regge ‘climate resilient’, which implies accounting for the impacts of the current climate while also taking into consideration the projected future situation. In the Regge Restoration Projects, the canalized river is restored to a dynamic and resilient, meandering river at different places. In addition, the safety of the residents against flooding is taken into account. In general, water retention serves the following objectives:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Moderating discharge peaks to prevent flooding downstream;</li>
<li>Restoring natural stream processes and stream character: (i) inundations, (ii) natural drainage course, (iii) smaller profiles (summer bed), (iv) higher flow rates;</li>
<li>Combating drought: (i) downstream smaller sections are possible so that the drainage base can be placed higher and the flux of groundwater to surface water can be reduced in size;(ii) water supply for weir management, irrigation water and drinking water;</li>
<li>Improving water quality by: (i) sedimentation and purification on the spot (green cleansing), (ii) realizing (as long as possible) a certain flow rate downstream, (iii) developing (wet) natural and landscape values, for instance as a stepping stone in the ecological structure.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The climate change projections are taken into account in the projects with the aim of ensuring that the river will be climate resilient in the future; ensuring that the abovementioned aspects will also remain valid under projected changing conditions.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p align="left" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">To create extra capacity to handle flood water, while maintaining a relatively small meandering river, a flood channel parallel to the meandering river has been introduced along the lower and middle Regge. Barriers just below the floodplain level separate the two channels. During average flow conditions, flow is routed only through the meander channel. During flood periods, flow is routed over the barriers and through the flood channel as well. This design reduces and delays the peak discharge. The peak discharge is reduced because the inundation area increases significantly from the reference situation as a result of the final design. The delay is due to the greater length of the Regge river system and the increased inundation area.</p>
<p align="left" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">To increase groundwater levels in dry periods, the surface water levels have to be raised. The design is adapted by increasing the flow width by 20%, resulting in a higher bottom level, which leads to a reduced draining effect.</p>
<p align="left" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">By removing weirs from the Regge, surface water levels and groundwater levels drop significantly during dry periods. Reduction of the flow area, increase of the hydraulic roughness and the increase in the length of the Regge slightly compensates for this. The surface and groundwater conditions are less favourable for wetland development than they are in the reference situation, while the initial idea was that a more natural river would have positive effects on wetlands.</p>
<p align="left" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">For the Lowland Regge (a blue/green ribbon through the Twente landscape), a wide flood plain is needed. Often, old meanders are the starting point for new meandering. The profile of the Regge is adjusted to provide the desired flow in the summer and sufficient variation in morphology, erosion and sedimentation processes.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, the Water Board Regge and Dinkel together with other stakeholders have worked to achieve the Regge Restoration Projects. Along the whole stretch of the Regge, there is cooperation with all parties through intensive consultations. The Regge Restoration Projects were realized in collaboration with:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Private landowners and users;</li>
<li>Municipalities Ommen, Twenterand, Hellendoorn, Wierden, Rijssen-Holten and courtyard of Twente;</li>
<li>The Province of Overijssel;</li>
<li>The Department of Public Works;</li>
<li>Twente region;</li>
<li>Conservation organizations: Landscape Overijssel, Natuurmonumenten, Forestry Commission.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In all projects, the consultation has led to local support. The Water Board throughout the implementation phase worked to actively involve the public through providing information and through integrated design processes for the redevelopment plans.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Success factors:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The Water Board Regge and Dinkel has a strong drive towards integrated water management;</li>
<li>The vision for the Regge was formally adopted by the Water Board;</li>
<li>National and European legislation and policy helped towards developing and implementing the plans;</li>
<li>The re-meandering projects are all integrated projects with multiple purposes;</li>
<li>The measures are based on research;</li>
<li>The WFD objectives are not the only objectives for the projects;</li>
<li>The integrated approach adopted and combining objectives has led to cost-efficiency;</li>
<li>All projects have sufficient support from the local communities.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Limiting factors are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The current board of the Water Board (Water Board elections take place every four year) was not involved in developing the vision, but now has to make related decisions;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintenance after implementation is not integrated into the plans;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Re-meandering may lead to local flooding;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Water Board has only limited insight into the effectiveness of the restructuring measures for the ecology policy goals;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In some places, private landownership hindered implementation of the plans. In some instances, expropriation was required.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Total cost of the various projects is around 25 million euro. Enhancement of the natural design of the Regge is an integral part of many of the projects accompanied by the creation of new nature. By creating an ecological corridor the intention is to increase the coherence of these nature areas. This corridor allows plants and animals to spread. In addition, space is created for viable and profitable agriculture around the Reggedal. The enhanced natural design of the Regge also is intended to boost recreation and tourism in the municipalities through which the Regge flows. Plans also include establishing housing next to the water and improving the perception of water in urban areas. A monetary assessments of benefits was not included in designing the projects. Nevertheless, the projects were considered necessary to deal with the current and projected future problems. Moreover, benefits were to be found in improved agricultural possibilities as well as recreation and nature. An evaluation of the projects was done in 2012. This included evaluating if the projects were appropriate in reaching the goals of developing a resilient hydrological system and improving the ecology, and if they were effective (i.e. were the efforts and expenditure reasonable related to the goals and realised benefits). For most of the projects, the evaluation showed that to a large extent the hydrological and ecological goals had been achieved.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Restoration of the Oka River’s upper estuary, part of the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The estuary of the Oka River is located within the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve, on the coast of Biscay, Basque Country, north of Spain. It is an area of high ecological value. Its landscape has been transformed over the years by human activities, as it has been inhabited since Prehistoric times. The most important activities affecting the landscape of the estuary have been agriculture, cattle rising and a shipyard. While the first two have practically disappeared, the shipyard activity is still on-going, although with less intensity than in previous decades. Some activities, such as the construction of a canal in the upper estuary, have led the ecosystem to lose part of its original functionality. The restoration of the upper estuary of the Oka River aims to recover some of the lost ecosystems functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change will increase pressure on this fragile ecosystem. Temperatures are projected to rise and annual precipitation is expected to decrease, while the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events could increase. This will affect water regimes, increasing the river flow and the risk of flooding as well as the erosion of the basin, the flow of suspended sediment in the estuary area and the risk of clogging of tidal fluvial channels. Sea level rise and expected increase in the intensity and frequency of marine storms could lead to the erosion of the intertidal and supra-littoral zone of the beach, as already experienced in some areas, as well as to an increased erosion of the estuary marshes. The Oka River estuary cannot fully adapt naturally to climate change, in particular due to the presence of dams and other artificial barriers along its course. The restoration of the Oka River upper estuary seeks to improve its adaptation capacity by removing dykes and other typologies of barriers and recover previously existing marshland.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">According to climate change projections included in the “Basque Country’s Climate Change Strategy for 2050” the average annual and seasonal temperature and the occurrence of heat waves are expected to increase. During winter months, it is projected that minimum temperatures will rise between 1 and 3º C by 2100, while during summer months a possible increase of 3º C by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century in maximum temperatures might occur. Due to these changes, longer and more recurrent heat waves are expected by the end of the century. A decrease in precipitation, especially in spring time, is projected, ranging between -10% and -30% by 2100. An increase of events of extreme precipitation up to a 30% by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is also expected, whit consequent increased risk and danger of flooding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same “Basque Country’s Climate Change Strategy for 2050” is also mentioned that sea level is expected to rise between 29 and 49 cm by 2100, further increasing the risk of flooding in the estuary of the reserve. Moreover, climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of marine storms, which are responsible of the erosion of the intertidal and supra-littoral zone of the beach. This process is already happening in some areas. For example, the beach of Laida, which semi-confine the estuary, suffered strong erosion due to the storms that occurred in 2014 and as a consequence supra-littoral zone disappeared, with damages to access infrastructures, breakwater walls and channeling as well as limitation to recreational activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering current climate related pressures and those generated by future climate change, in the next 50 years it will be necessary to continue working on the renaturalisation of the Oka river estuary, including the removal of artificial barriers that currently limit the estuary extension and recovery the previously existing marshland. This would improve autonomous adaptation capacity of the estuary ecosystem.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objectives of the actions implemented in the upper estuary of the Oka River are: (i) Improve the resilience of the estuarine ecosystems to the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and changes in the water regime; (ii) Increase local biodiversity thanks to the recovery of part of the ecosystem's functionality; (iii) Increase the sustainable public use of the natural space of the Urdaibai Biosphere reserve.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Restoration activities aiming to recover the previously existing marshland have been implemented in the upper estuary of the Oka River, including the permanent flooding of the Barrutibaso area part of the upper estuary. Moreover, the functionality of part of the original intertidal channel of the Oka River’s lower section has been recovered. As part of these restoration activities, some of the dykes and other artificial barriers have been removed to improve the estuary renaturalisation, while embankments have been constructed to create lagoons that will become intertidal zones in the future. The restoration of marshlands formerly drained for sanitary reasons can help the estuary to face climate change. Marshes, in addition to protect against the effects of sea level rise, play an important ecological role providing new habitats to various species of amphibians and birds and improving their adaptation capacity. Moreover, the permanent presence of brackish water favours the elimination of some invasive species (e.g. <em>Baccharis halimifolia</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restoration project also included other interventions and activities:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The construction of a 14 km pathway network and of a pedestrian and cycling bridge connecting the neighbouring municipalities among each other and to the Oka river estuary, aiming to facilitate sustainable visit of the area;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The development of tools for environmental education, the most notable being a smartphone application providing information on the habitats, species and culture of the area. Moreover, panels have been installed providing on-site information on local habitats and species.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Eradication of invasive species (as <em>Baccharis halimifolia</em> and <em>Cortaderia selloana</em>) in an area of approximately 700 ha of the estuary.</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The restoration project of the Oka River’s upper estuary included the organisation of several meetings with different stakeholders, such as the municipalities located in the area, landowners and environmental associations. Stakeholder engagement aimed at setting common objectives. In addition, informative talks with civil society have been held in town halls and recreational activities have been developed to advertise the project and improve awareness on climate change adaptation.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The newly constructed pathway network has facilitated the connection of different municipalities through sustainable transport (bicycle and walking). Besides improving the sustainable public use of the estuary area it also contributed in raising awareness on the restoration project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the municipalities included in the area where the restoration measures have been implemented did not take part into the project, thus posing some limitation to its complete development. Therefore, some phases of the project (mainly dealing with removal of some of the dams) are still to be implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the ingrained sense of ownership of the people in the area to be restored has made the implementation of some of the project activities difficult. The 1998 Coastal Law establishes an area 100m wide on both sides of the river, where land owners can make objections to actions planned. For this reason some actions included in the restoration project have not been implemented, yet. Nevertheless, negotiations are continuing in order to make sure that the totality of the project is implemented.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has been completely funded by the Department of Environment, Land planning and Housing of the Government of Basque Country. The overall amount of the project budget is about 2.5 million euro.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spanish Law 42/2007 on natural heritage and biodiversity supports the implementation of the restoration project of the Oka River’s upper estuary, as among its purposes it includes conservation, sustainable use, improvement and restoration of natural ecosystems and habitats. The Urdaibai Biosphere reserve is located in the Basque Country, where the local government has set various strategies and plans that promote this type of restoration works, including in particular the “Basque Country’s Climate Change Strategy for 2050”, the Environment Framework Program 2020 and the Biodiversity Strategy.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Implementation of restoration measures started in 2010 and is still on-going. Most of the measures have been implemented, while few of them are waiting for permission from the Spanish Ministry, as in the case of the dyke removal in the upper estuary.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Relocation as adaptation to flooding in the Eferdinger Becken, Austria]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The area of the Eferdinger Becken, Upper Austria, is a small area that lies on the Danube. It has no protection against floods with a 100-year return time: the flood-prone area includes about 154 houses that flood regularly. Due to the importance of the retention space for the discharge and the difficult technical feasibility, passive flood protection was considered as more suitable. Homeowners needed to decide on relocation by the end of 2015. The federal and the regional governments compensate citizens 80% of the value of the house if they agree to move.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of Austrian municipalities face an increasing risk from flood hazards due to a number of factors, including on one hand, more frequent extreme hydrological events likely exacerbated by climate change (+4% to +10%) and on the other hand, increasing public pressure to expand residential construction in flood-prone areas. Even if there is no legal right to claim for flood protection in Austria flooding poses a political pressure for Austrian governments to act. Furthermore, relocation as an effective long-term solution for flood protection has a longer history in the Austrian part of the Danube Basin (see also Marchland, Enns-Enghage where such reallocation has already occurred).</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The region is one of the most river flood-prone areas in Austria with major flood events occurred in 1991, 1997, 2002 and 2013. As a consequence, the national and regional authorities have focused their attention on the development of various adaptation strategies, such as relocation of large parts of the houses in the area. The aims was to integrate all potential residents into the relocation program, especially to communicate the potential hazards and risks, define problems and to find common objectives and measures. Furthermore, key tasks were to organise and ensure financial support to relocation from the regional and national authorities.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">After the major flooding events in 2002 and 2013 it became clear that the only truly effective flood protection measure in the Eferdingen Becken area is relocation of households away from the highest risk areas. This was supported by the results of a cost-benefit analysis that found relocation to be the most cost efficient option of adaptation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In consultation with the affected households and other interested parties (e.g. the civil protection authorities), a mapping of the area for resettlement was undertaken and approved in a short time and in high agreement. It included 154 properties. In order to be able to offer a compensation of resettlement for the house owners, the local government negotiated and agreed with the Ministry of Finance on support by the national funds. The federal support amounted to 250 million EUR. Additional to federal funds, the regional government provided 75 million EUR funding. The rate of compensation was fixed at 80% of the value of the existing house, determined by an independent valuation. The majority of the valuations indicated compensation volumes below 500,000 EUR, with some properties set to receive compensation above 500,000 EUR. The Federal Ministry of Finance proofed the valuations and approved the proposed sums of compensation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The households had to apply for relocation compensation before end of year 2015, which was later extended to mid-2016. Property owner can decide on its own whether to apply for the relocation compensation and accept the related offer. By January 2016 149 households had requested and 146 already received relocation compensation offers. Out of those, 80 home owners have decided to relocate while the others decided to stay. The residents who decided to move were supported in obtaining substitute plots of land in the region (usually former forest and semi natural areas) at an affordable price. To achieve this goal, the regional authorities dedicated special areas (replacement properties) for the householders for their relocation. Furthermore, the regional authorities fixed the purchase price to overcome the potential pitfall of land price speculation within the region. The first payments of the compensations started at the beginning of 2015. 20% of the funding is used for necessary demolitions, deposition of debris and re-cultivation of the area. The long-term construction prohibition for each of the vulnerable land plots is fixed by an entry in the land registry. There is however an exception provided for those who choose to stay in the flood prone area and decide to move to higher floors in their houses – reconstruction of these higher floors for living purposes is permissible.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the first organised waves of relocation were received by the local population with high reservations and did not attract many volunteers for resettlement, after the 2013 flooding event the residents increasingly began to inquire about relocation possibilities and support. The regional government developed a map of resettlement areas based on risk levels, and the level of difficulty to provide technical solutions and hazard response. The map was discussed and agreed with the mayors of the affected municipalities, representatives from the communities as well as with an advisory committee which was set up to represent all interested parties. As a result in January 2016 146 out of 154 highly affected property owners applied for the valuation of compensation and 80 out of those finally decided for resettlement.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to attachment to the property and disbelief in repeated high flooding risks the first organised waves of voluntary relocation did not gain sufficient interest from home-owners. However, the extreme floods and high losses of 2002 and 2013 served as ‘eye openers’ and convinced many of the residents to decide on resettlement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A 250 million EUR budget for flood protection including resettlements and technical flood protection in the Eferdinger Becken was negotiated with the federal government and bindingly secured with a state contract in a record time, unique in the history of the country. This allowed offering 80% of house value compensations to the relocation volunteers, which served as one of the key success factors. The local authorities also designated some limited special relocation areas and fixed land prices to avoid land price speculations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People who are affected by relocations are confronted with profound changes in their lives. This requires overcoming the emotional attachment to the place and in particular to adapt to the new environment, as well as coping with financial burden and re-building a new neighbourly social network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The non-movers were most likely older and less mobile people who are in fact less resilient to cope with future flood events. The consequences were higher vulnerability within the remaining communities with the fact that younger people (more likely to be resilient) moved away. Nevertheless, the relocation process can be seen as success story, wherein the exposure and vulnerability to climate change in the flood-prone areas were reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another success factor seems to be the fact that each property owner can decide on its own if she/he accepts the offer. This is fundamental different to other reallocation action in Austria where the community had to decide commonly for or against the reallocation (e.g. Marchland).</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In total a budget of 250 million EUR was agreed by the provincial (regional) and federal (national) government. The costs for the resettlement are shared between the federal level (50% of the calculated time value of the buildings including destruction costs) the province level (30%) and the owner (20%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, the key aim to reduce the exposure to flooding risk and to keep the retention volume along the River Danube has been achieved. At January 2016 the exposure of households to flooding risk in the area was  reduced by more than 50% (taking into account the number of households that have already decided to relocate), which will increase as more home owners accept the relocation offers. The relocation process was supported by a cost-benefit assessment which however is not publicly accessible.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The properties from which the citizens will be reallocated will not change ownership. The property ownership will remain, but the zoning will be changed from building area to grass land and future building activities are strongly restricted (e.g. buildings for agricultural production are allowed if this is needed by agricultural production laws).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost sharing between the federal and provincial level is regulated in a specific inner-Austrian contract according to the Austrian constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The construction time of the building played an important role if funds can be granted. According to the technical guiding principles for the federal waterways administration (RIWA T BWS) no flood protection measures for buildings and infrastructure erected after 01.07.1990 can be funded in Austria. In the case of the Eferdinger Becken relocation and related compensation are defined possible according to a legal opinion.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Unclear, but experiences from other cases in Austria show that the process can take more than 10 years. In January 2016, 146 owners out of 154 included in the specific risk zone (protection zone for flooding) have received a funding offer for resettlement. 80 of them have accepted the offer. Nine buildings were already completely destructed by the end of 2016.</p>

    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Forested Infiltration Area (FIA) is proving to be an effective tool in Northern Italy helping to address water scarcity challenges and/or to achieve environmental benefits over the long term. FIA is a method to recharge groundwater aquifers by channelling surface waters during times of excess into designated areas that have been planted with various species of trees and/or shrubs. With an extension of 2.5 hectares, the FIA of Carmignano di Brenta (Padua) – called Bosco Limite - is the largest in Veneto region, constructed on private land which was previously used to grow maize. The FIA of Bosco Limite has a multi-functional character. In one hand, the artificial water network connected to river Brenta allows to recharge the aquifer of a million cubic metres of water per hectare each year. On the other, the reforestation project, which comprises approximately 2,300 native plants, besides favouring water purification, has a significant naturalistic value for the local ecological network, providing ecosystem services such as biomass production and carbon sequestration and storage.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The aquifers of the upper plains of the Veneto and Friuli provide drinking water supply for most of both regions. A number of industries abstract groundwater, as well as the agricultural sector which withdrawals groundwater in addition to the amount for irrigation taken from surface waters. At the same time, the upper plain is the main recharge area for the lower aquifer systems. Therefore, protection and conservation of the unconfined aquifer are essential for assuring future water availability. However, demand for freshwater is rising with population growth, land use change and projected increase in climate variability, posing water availability and quality under pressure. In particular, the variations of the regional hydrologic cycle related to climate change (especially the intensity, location and seasonal variability of precipitation) pose challenges for the sustainable management of groundwater resources and related ecosystems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the last 30-40 years, the risks for ecosystems depending on the aquifers in the upper plains of Veneto and Friuli regions have become clear. The decline of water table levels as result of overexploitation has led to the disappearance of wetlands and springs, while the impacts of agriculture activities (e.g. due to fertilization) has contributed to quality degradation of groundwater. These negative effects are likely to worsen in the next decades as the frequency and intensity of droughts and water scarcity is expected to intensify (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22940008">Baruffi et al., 2012</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A comprehensive assessment on the effects of climate change on groundwater resources has been provided in the context of the Life+ <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/metadata/projects/tool-for-regional-scale-assessment-of-groundwater-storage-improvement-in-adaptation-to-climate-change">TRUST</a> project aimed to analyse potential impacts and risks from climate change to groundwater in the high Veneto and Friuli Plain (Northern Italy) in order to address adaptation strategies such as Managed Artificial Recharge (MAR) techniques. Climate change projections (2071–2100, A1B climate scenario) show that the groundwater recharge, both in the Veneto and in the Friuli study areas at the end of the irrigation period, will decrease by more than 70% with respect to the reference period (1971–2000). During winter, future mean precipitation over the TRUST region appears to be about 20% higher than in the control period. In contrast, rainfall tends to decrease during the other seasons, especially in summer, when precipitation appears to be 15% weaker. Managing aquifer recharge is a complex issue due to different sources of uncertainty related to spatial and temporal distribution of water, soil sealing and the aquifer behaviour to the withdrawals for potable and irrigation purposes.</p>

    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"> Environmental and social objectives of the Forested Infiltration Area of Bosco Limite are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Promote water conservation by saving, approximately, 12,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water per year, also improving adaptation to droughts and water scarcity impacts of climate change;</li>
<li>Increase the biodiversity by encouraging the settlement of autochthonous plants and animals of the region;</li>
<li>Protect the landscape by introducing a new oak-hornbeam forest, which is typical of the Po Valley, re-establishing an historic landscape that has almost disappeared;</li>
<li>Capture 50 t of carbon dioxide per year in 30 years;</li>
<li>Introduce a new source of renewable energy provided by wood biomass for domestic use;</li>
<li>Improve the area by restoring its natural value and offering environmental education initiatives to schools and local associations; and</li>
<li>Improve the quality of life for the local population through the creation of new green areas.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Forested Infiltration Area system was conceived and developed for the first time in 2007 by Veneto Agricoltura, the Veneto region Authority responsible for aspects related to agricultural, forestry and agri-food development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the FIA aims at maximizing environmental and economic-productive functions. In doing so, the land surface has to be organized in a way that allow the cultivation of specific crop and exploit as much as possible the high infiltration rate that distinguishes the soils of Bosco Limite area, in order to provide for the groundwater recharge. The infrastructures and the subsequent management of the FIA must follow and respect a series of hydraulic, environmental, agronomic and forestry principles, which are strictly interconnected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The innovative method consists in exploiting in a positive way the high infiltration rate of the soils above the resurgence belt, allocating their surface to the cultivation of a forest that allows to maximize the infiltration rate. The solutions consist in infiltration areas that feature a total of 10 longitudinal infiltration channels having a sinusoidal shape with wide curves. Each channel has a length of approximately 93 meters and are spaced about 14 meters apart (inter-axial). Four of these channels run East-West (first area) and six run North-South (second area). Water is evenly distributed in the recharge area by means of a water level regulation system, which divides the available flow equally among the individual infiltration channels. Each infiltration channel has water level control structures that are spaced 30 meters apart. These structures enable the system to form a ‘reservoir’, which improves the efficacy of the infiltration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The FIA has to be supervised upstream by an input sediment control system and a system for monitoring infiltration waters. The sediment trap, or rather a small pool with a surface area of approximately 50 m<sup>2</sup>, collects suspended solids present in the intake water. This reduces blockages of the channels and ensures a longer useful lifespan for the system. The excess excavated material is used to create a rise on the North-western side of the infiltration area, providing a visual and acoustic barrier between the forested area and the adjacent public road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forested area is a naturalistic woodland that consists of sections of four parallel rows of vegetation alternating with channels. One of the four rows of each section is destined for periodic cutting (to permit maintenance of the channels by the Land Reclamation Board), while the other three contain tall trees. The rows parallel to the channels, which are also sinusoidal, are planted in two different ways. The rows that are to be periodically cut (located to the South or the East: about 1,400 plants/ha dedicated to Five-year Short Rotation Forestry) contain alternating secondary tree species (narrow-leafed ash and common hornbeam) that can be cut as required for maintenance. In the three central rows of tall trees, primary tree species (common oak, durmast oak, common ash, field elm, poplar and linden) alternate with secondary species (from a minimum of 1,200 plants/ha to a maximum of 2,400 plants/ha which are narrow-leafed ash and common hornbeam). Hazelnut, alder buckthorn, common buckthorn, blackthorn, wild privet and cornel trees are planted along the exterior borders of the woodland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of the FIA hydraulic system works by loading the drains for a duration of up to 200 days (from September to April) if water can be derived from the rivers without adversely affecting its hydrological regime. The possible use of the FIA system periodically occurs during the irrigation season (from April to September).</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The aquifer is managed by the Brenta Land Reclamation Board, together with Veneto Agricoltura and local authorities. The Bosco Limite project has been supported by various sponsors which have been actively involved in the project to mitigate part of their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the support of Etifor Srl (a spin-off of the University of Padua that provides international consulting services to help organizations grasp the full value of the products and services provided by nature) there is the plan to implement a new Forested Infiltration Area of 7ha at the level of Medio-Brenta, the biggest ever realized in the Veneto region. In this context, Etra SpA (a water utilities company), Coldiretti Veneto (trade union agriculture organization), Etifor Srl (Padua University spin-off for ecosystem evaluation) and interested farmers are working within the operational group “<a href="https://www.etifor.com/en/portfolio/gruppo-operativo-brenta-2020/">Gruppo Operativo Brenta 2020 (GO Brenta 2020)</a><span>”</span> which has been financed by Misura 16.1 of the Rural Development Program 2014-2020 (RDP). The GO Brenta 2020 is planning to identify areas and owners that could host the new FIA and explore innovative funding mechanisms. Etifor Srl is currently focusing on the governance among the local authorities, the development of payments for ecosystem services and the screening of European and regional funding. Etifor Srl will support Etra Spa and Consiglio di Bacino Brenta (in charge of local water management) in the economic, legal and fundraising activities for the potential creation of a dedicated fund. By applying a “green fee” on the water bill, the fund would be able to collect the capital for environmental projects in the catchment and recharge areas. The Facebook website of Bosco Limite is constantly updated with all activities organized in the area.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forested Infiltration Area, as all the other type of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), is a promising adaptation measure for climate change vulnerability related to water management. The case of Bosco Limite proves that FIA is crucial to control over-abstraction and for the restoration of the groundwater balance, improving at the same time the quality of groundwater and part of ecosystems functions. Furthermore, forests contribute to reduce heatwaves and mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The measured data in the implemented FIA lead to very encouraging values in terms of infiltration capacity per hectare which is in the range of 20 - 50 l/s/ha, depending on soil permeability. Infiltration values tend to increase over time thanks to the root effect of plants adjacent to the trenches. The same benefit is difficult to find in other type of MAR systems, which instead show a significant decline in the infiltration capacity over time due to progressive clogging, calling for extra and expensive maintenance, necessary to recover the initial values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the stakeholders’ network and new local partnerships are keys for the success of FIA. It has been proven that the income from FIA is higher than other typical crops such as maize or soy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Limiting factors depends on specific characteristics of the area used for FIA which include: i) the characteristics of the subsoil and soil, i.e. their pedological and hydrogeological aspects which determine the infiltration capacity of the area; ii) land use, i.e. what stands on top of the soil, which again affects the water infiltration processes; iii) the availability of the land for the installation of recharge systems, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1999 the council of the Veneto region adopted a project called “MO.S.A.V. - Structural Model of Aqueducts” (<span>Modello Strutturale degli Aquedotti del Veneto)</span> which aims to reduce the fragmentation of aqueduct structures and increase no less than 15 % the efficiency and safety related to water drinking supply and water treatment systems. The MO.S.A.V. is structured in three interconnected water sources where the Central Veneto Aqueduct (SAVEC), which include the territory suitable for managed aquifer recharge, is the larger. A new project related to SAVEC aims to provide approximately 30% of Veneto’s drinking water supply especially to Polesine area, becoming a strategic and essential resource for the region. This poses some other related risks that need to be addressed such as groundwater depletion, the decrease of river’s vital outflow and the increase of pollutants from agricultural activities and drainage from urban areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a matter of fact, FIA are not a remedy for water scarcity in all areas. Aquifer conditions must be suitable and (excess) source water must be present. It is therefore important to assess in advance the potential of FIA applications before field activities initiate.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructural part of the infiltration system (infiltration channels, a sediment control system and a system for monitoring infiltration waters) has been financed by the Life+ project <a href="http://www.lifeaquor.org/en">AQUOR</a> (LIFE 2010 ENV/IT/380) "Implementation of a water saving and artificial recharging participated strategy for the quantitative groundwater layer rebalance of the upper Vicenza's plain” (2011-2015, overall budget € 1,814,548). Costs of the forested part of the FIA were covered by funds provided by Veneto Agricoltura (through the Rural Development Program - 2007-2013) as part of an already existing project for foresting cultivated lands and for the creation of permanent forests. The creation of Bosco Limite also involved funds provided by local authorities and private businesses, which invested in this project in order to compensate the emissions and environmental impacts derived by their activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to information collected through interviews, the owner of Bosco Limite signed two 10 years long agreements in 2011. From the Municipality of Carmignano di Brenta, the owner receives 1.500 euro per years for opening Bosco Limite to the local community every day and enable the holding of recreational and educational activities. With the other agreement with the Brenta Land Reclamation Board, the owner gets an equivalent of 1,200 euro/ha per year for providing the infiltration water service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Bosco Limite produces firewood obtained by the ordinary maintenance activities of the forest that is sufficient to satisfy the annual need for the owner’s family. The remuneration from timber will be quantified at the 30th year. At the end of 2018 there will be probably the first income from the presence of truffle-production trees.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Italy, there is no ad hoc legislation on managed aquifer recharge schemes. Presently, relevant provisions on water management may be found in the so-called ‘Environmental Code’ 152/2006 (EnC). Articles 104 and 105 aims at protecting the quality level of water sources and establishing specific measures to manage the discharge to superficial water and groundwater. Other relevant provisions can be found in the Regional Water Protection Plans adopted by Italian Regions, including Veneto, in compliance with the EnC. These Plans provide for measures to protect the quality and the quantity of the water resources. At the national level the recent amendment of Article 104 of the EnC has led to the adoption of paragraph 4-bis according to which the competent authority can authorize the augmentation under controlled conditions of groundwater bodies in accordance with the criteria set by the Ministry of the Environment.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Agroforestry: agriculture of the future? The case of Montpellier]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The agriculture sector in Montpellier is highly vulnerable to higher temperature and more frequent droughts associated with projected climate change. To prepare for the effects of climate change it is important that agriculture in Montpellier takes appropriate adaptation measures. The current system, largely based on monoculture, is deemed to be more vulnerable compared to alternatives such as the cultivation of a mixture of crops and species, especially a mixture of trees and crops as in agroforestry. Such a practice has been adopted in Montpellier, as part of the SAFE project; a French national scheme for planting half a million hectares of agroforestry during the next 25 years based on results obtained by INRA at Montpellier.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Montpellier is a city in Southern France. It is situated on hilly ground 10 kilometres inland from the Mediterranean coast on the River Lez. Montpellier has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa), with mild, somewhat wet winters, and very warm, rather dry summers. The monthly mean temperatures range from 7.1 °C (44.8 °F) in January to 23.4 °C (74.1 °F) in July. Annual precipitation is around 660 millimetres, and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer. Several studies project that the Montpellier climate will change in the future with higher temperature and more frequent droughts conditions and that these changes are expected to have an important impact on the agriculture sector. To cope with this, it is important that agriculture in Montpellier take appropriate adaptation measures. The challenge is to make food production more efficient, sustainable and able to cope with the projected effects of climate change.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective is to make the Montpellier agricultural systems more resilient to the effects of climate change, such as increasing temperatures or droughts, water and biotic stresses and more extreme events.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The implemented solution is based on adoption of an agroforestry scheme, a combination of trees and crops cultivation. In the case of Montpellier, the scheme adopted was comprised of a combination of walnut trees and wheat cultivation. Agroforestry provides a different land use option, compared with separated traditional arable and forestry systems. It makes use of the complementarity between trees and crops, so that the available resources can be more effectively exploited. It is a practice that respects the environment and has an obvious landscape benefit. Efficient, modern versions of agroforestry have been developed, that are adapted to the constraints imposed by mechanisation. The agroforestry plot remains productive for the farmer and generates continuous revenue, which is not the case when arable land is exclusively reforested. Agroforestry then allows for the diversification of farm activity and makes better use of environmental resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, over time, agroforestry farms can become less dependent on crop subsidies, and less susceptible to crop price variations, as timber generates a significant part of their income. The amenity value of silvoarable parklands in the near future may also be a valuable asset to farm enterprises.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Several stakeholder organisations from France, The Netherlands, and Greece were involved in the SAFE project. In France, APCA (the national chamber of Agriculture in France) was responsible for the establishment of a network of agroforestry system demonstration plots that is now a very efficient tool for agroforestry extension. Most stakeholders organisations involved in the SAFE project have recently been involved in coordinating other R&#38;D agroforestry projects in Spain, Germany, England, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation strategies in Montpellier were part of the SAFE (Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe) project, which was funded in support of the European Common Agricultural Policy. The project provided models and databases for assessing the profitability of silvoarable systems, and suggested unified European policy guidelines for implementing agroforestry. To meet these expectations, the SAFE project developed biophysical and socio-economic tools to inform farmers and policy-makers of the potential for silvoarable agroforestry to contribute to the integrated and sustainable development of European rural areas. The knowledge developed during the SAFE Project, provided opportunities for farmers to improve their competitiveness.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main benefits can be summarized as follow:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>INRA (Institut Nantional de la Recherche Agronomique) researchers showed that the production from one hectare of a walnut/wheat mix is the same as for 1.4 hectares with trees and crops separated. This was a 40% increase in productivity, far better than any other innovation introduced by agronomists in the recent past.</li>
<li>Agroforestry is less vulnerable to climate change. Trees provide shelter to crops and reduce damages due to high spring temperature.</li>
<li>Biodiversity is increased since it creates a diverse habitat where wildlife species can live. It also acts in controlling pests and enhancing pollination.</li>
<li>Farmers can diversify their products, increase their income and improve soil and water quality, reduce (wind) erosion and prevent damage due to flooding. Soil and water quality is improved, so preventing from erosion.</li>
<li>Agroforestry plays a role in maintaining land for future generation.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Agroforestry schemes are a long term investment. It takes some time until trees mature and provide the functions and benefits described. Short term investments that aim at quick financial returns hardly ever support agroforestry schemes.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During the late twentieth century, the advantages of agroforestry systems have been overlooked. Even traditional silvoarable landscapes, whose benefits are widely recognised, have received little attention from policy makers and research organisations. Across Europe the integration of trees and arable agriculture is currently unattractive to farmers, simply because the available grant or subsidy schemes are designed for forestry or agriculture, and do not support agroforestry. In some countries, agroforestry systems can actually be declared illegal, because they are a category which is not recognised for taxation purposes. This preposterous situation has had unfortunate consequences with some EU-funded silvoarable agroforestry experiments being closed prematurely because local agencies deemed that they were not eligible for agricultural or forestry grants. A mixed or combined status of agroforestry plots was not available at the time of project proposal, neither at the European level nor at the National level, preventing both forest and agricultural grant policies to be applied.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Agroforestry is a long-term adaptation measure. In Montpellier, the agroforestry scheme has been implemented for 20 years.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[A transboundary depoldered area for flood protection and nature: Hedwige and Prosper Polders]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hedwige-Prosper Polder project is part of the <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/../../../viewmeasure?ace_measure_id=5002"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 9.0pt; mso-ascii-font-family: Verdana; mso-hansi-font-family: Verdana;">Belgian Sigma Plan</span></a></span>: this integrated plan is reinforcing dikes and quay walls and opening flood areas to protect land along the Scheldt Estuary and the upstream basin against floods. In this project, the outer defences of the Hertogin-Hedwige (hereinafter referred to as Hedwige) and the Prosper Polders – low lying areas of reclaimed land – will be removed, reopening these areas to the tides. This process (which can be called ‘depoldering’) involves moving dike protection inland. Doing so will provide room for water during tidal surges, thereby reducing the risk of floods, and re-establishing an estuarine natural area. While nearly all Sigma Plan projects take place on Belgian territory, this is an exception as the Hedwige polder lies on Dutch territory.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The occurrence of storm surges in the North Sea has increased significantly since the 1950s, and sea-level rise is projected to further raise this threat in coming decades. Storm surges threaten Antwerp (Belgium) in particular as the Scheldt estuary narrows considerably at this point, thereby boosting high water levels. The Hedwige and Prosper Polders are crucially located just before the Scheldt reaches Antwerp. Opening these two polders will provide ‘storage’ for storm surge waters, reducing the water level at Antwerp and upstream and thereby improving safety in this urban and industrial area.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective is to create new estuarine intertidal natural area. The project will also improve flood protection as part of the overall Sigma Plan.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hedwige-Prosper Polder project is one of a series of projects being undertaken along the Scheldt and its tributaries as part of the Sigma Plan. It creates a new estuarine nature area and contributes to flood protection. The new nature areas and increased flood protection will be achieved by moving dike protection inland, thereby exposing the currently protected polders to the tidal influence of the Scheldt River. The new dikes constructed inland will provide flood protection for the low-lying hinterland.  This type of project can be called ‘depoldering’ (it is also part of ‘managed realignment’, a term used in the UK). The new dikes will have a height at 10.2 meters above sea level (measured by Normaal Amsterdams Peil, Standard Amsterdam Level, NAP) across most of their length.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In total, a natural area of 465 hectares will be developed in the two former polders, of which 295 hectares will be on Dutch territory and 170 hectares in Belgian territory. These 465 hectares will combine with the adjacent Saeftinghe wetlands area to create a brackish intertidal area of approximately 4100 hectares in total. The Hedwige-Prosper polders will not be directly connected with Saeftinghe, however, as a dike containing pipelines separates the two areas and will remain in place. The creation of new estuarine nature areas is part of the Scheldt Agreements between the Netherlands and Flanders: the work at Hedwige polder will contribute to fulfilling the Dutch commitment to create 600 hectares of such areas. (The resulting intertidal nature areas will be part of the work that the Netherlands and Belgium will undertake to meet obligations under the EU Habitats Directive, also as compensation for natural areas taken over the Port of Antwerp as well as dredging of the Scheldt).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To promote the creation of the desired natural area, a system of creeks will be dug in the polders. Accompanying works include filling in the existing drainage system and removing other drainage related infrastructure, removing hard infrastructure such as roads, and removing existing vegetation and where necessary some existing marshland.  Following these modifications, natural processes will be allowed to shape the area into increasingly natural conditions. These marshlands will contribute to the self-cleaning capacity of the estuary; moreover, the wetlands are an important source of silica for diatom algae which are at the basis of the food web. The creation of the new intertidal nature area is expected to result in new recreational opportunities. The proposed design includes the construction of a nature pavilion and eco-lodges, as well as a number of walking and biking paths, viewpoints, information signs, benches and parking places for visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of late 2014, the outer dikes had been removed at the Belgian Prosper polder, opening this area to the tide. The new inland dike was completed in 2015. The building permit for the new inland dike on the Dutch part – Hedwige Polder - is granted. Construction is expected to start at the end of 2017 and will take approximately three years.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project encountered opposition: in particular, the work planned for the Hedwige Polder was a contentious issue in the Netherlands and especially in the province of Zeeland where it is located. The Belgian owner of agricultural land in the Hedwige Polder mounted an extensive legal opposition to the project (His legal opposition to the depoldering of the Prosper Polder in Belgium, where he also owned lands, had ended in 2011). Some farmers and residents in the Netherlands joined the protests (opposition was comparatively mild in Belgium). Their concerns included the loss of agricultural land plus resistance to depoldering in general and a fear that more depoldering projects might be undertaken in Zeeland. This opposition led the project to be postponed by the Dutch national government, which requested studies of alternatives, including different sites and alternative work in the project area. The analysis did not identify an acceptable alternative and the Dutch government in 2012 decided to go ahead with the works at Hedwige polder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning documents were then drawn up and made available to the public in September 2013 for a six-week comment period. Approximately 2000 individuals and organizations submitted comments regarding the plan. There was also a meeting at the local town hall on 10 September 2013. Prior to this meeting, a group symbolically burnt the government plans for the Hedwige Polder in front of the town hall. Despite this local opposition, the Dutch government committed to completing the project by 2019. The Dutch Council of State on 12 November 2014 ruled all legal opposition to the project unfounded.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For the Sigma plan overall, economic analysis showed that a combination of projects, including the Hedwige-Prosper Polder project, would be more cost-effective in protecting urban areas and economic activities than building a large storm surge barrier. For the project itself, the estuarine natural areas envisioned will need to be maintained over time. Concerns have been expressed that the sedimentation rates in the project areas could be too high, resulting in areas not compatible with the natural or flood protection objectives of the project. Opposition in the Netherlands was a delaying factor.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A cost-benefit analysis for the Dutch government studied several project alternatives and indicated that the selected project option for depoldering the Hedwige polder in the Netherlands would cost between 40.0 to 49.3 million Euros (The costs for depoldering the Prosper polder in Belgium was estimated at 25.8 million Euros).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Benefits from the project taken into account in the cost-benefit analysis include: improvement in water quality, increase in natural area, changes in recreational opportunities, improvement in air quality due to a reduction in fine dust originating from ploughed fields (reduction of 30 tonnes per year PM10), reduction in pesticide use and a reduction in water level during storm surges. The flood protection benefit will be experienced mainly on Belgian territory, though other benefits will be experienced on both Belgian and Dutch sides of the border.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Losses that were identified include the reduction of part of the cultural (farming) landscape and removal of current recreational opportunities, living space and agricultural land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project costs for both the Hedwige and Prosper Polders will be covered mainly by the Belgian Sigma Plan, due to the importance of the project for Belgian integrated water management objectives, including maintaining shipping accessibility within the Scheldt and flood protection. Thus, a large portion of the costs for Hedwige Polder in the Netherlands will be paid for by the Flemish government. The Flemish government will cover the preparation and development costs related to the development of the estuarine natural area, including the costs of moving dike protection land inwards.  Flanders will also reimburse the Netherlands for the costs of expropriating the land. The Netherlands is responsible for other costs, such as support for agriculture following the project, the improvement of an internal dam and costs related to the analysis of alternatives to the project.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The depoldering of the Hedwige polder was agreed in 2005 in the treaty between the region of Flanders and the Dutch national government regarding the development of the Scheldt Estuary Development Plan 2010. In this agreement, the Netherlands agreed to develop at least 600 hectares of estuarine natural areas on Dutch territory. Flanders agreed to develop 1100 hectares of wetlands on Belgian territory. The Netherlands also committed to starting the depoldering of the Hedwige Polder at the latest by 2007 and to create at least 440 hectares of intertidal natural areas in this location. Following this agreement, however, opposition in the Netherlands led to delays. The European Commission started a legal procedure against the Netherlands with regard to its nature obligations. Following a review of alternatives, in 2012 the Dutch Government decided that Hedwige Polder would be depoldered as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project itself will contribute to the international obligations of the Netherlands and Belgium to conserve estuarine habitats (H1130, H1330) under the Habitats Directive. The site will become a Natura 2000 site that borders the already existing Natura 2000 site Westerschelde &#38; Saeftinghe.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The building permit for the new inland dike on the Dutch part – Hedwige Polder - is granted. Construction is expected to start at the end of 2017 and will take approximately three years; work on the Hedwige Polder should be completed by 2019. As of mid-2014, the Belgian Prosper Polder had been turned into a new flood area through depoldering (removal of its outer dykes) and the new inland dike was completed in 2015.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Urban storm water management in Augustenborg, Malmö]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The neighbourhood of Augustenborg, during the 1980s and 1990s an area of social and economic decline, was frequently flooded by an overflowing drainage system. Between 1998 and 2002 it was regenerated. The physical changes in infrastructure included the creation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), including 6km of water channels and ten retention ponds. The rainwater from roofs, roads and car parks is channelled through trenches, ditches, ponds and wetlands, with only the surplus being directed into a conventional sewer system. Green roofs have been installed on all developments built after 1998, and retrofitted on 10,000 square meters on an existing building. As a result, problems with flooding have ceased and the image of the area has been significantly improved..</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Augustenborg neighbourhood suffered from annual flooding caused by the old sewage drainage system being unable to cope with the combination of rainwater run-off, household waste water and pressure from other parts of the city. Resulting flooding was leading to damage to underground garages and basements, and restricted access to local roads and footpaths. Untreated sewage also often entered watercourses as a result of increasing pressure on the sewage treatment works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the changing climate, the number of heavy downpours in autumn and winter are projected to increase, with up to 8 days with over 10mm of precipitation possible by 2080s. This is likely to exacerbate the problems associated with rain water runoff management in urban areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Augustenborg, one of the first housing estates delivered under Sweden’s social housing policy in the 1950s,was characterised by high levels of unemployment, high turnover of residents and high percentage of immigrants.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The regeneration efforts in Augustenborg started in the 1990s, and developed into the Ekostaden Augustenborg project.  The key aim of the initiative was to create a more socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable neighbourhood. Whilst adaptation to climate change was not an explicit driver, the project aimed to address the issue of urban flooding in combination with measures aiming at reduction in CO2 emissions, and at improved waste management.</p>
<p align="left" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;">Due to recurring flooding problems it was proposed that stormwater from Augustenborg should be disconnected from the existing combined sewer, and drained by means of an open system. The main intention was that 70% of the storm water from roofs and sealed areas should be handled in the open system, eliminating combined sewer overflow completely, by both lowering the total volume of stormwater reaching pipes and reducing the peak flow rates.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">While no climate change analysis was carried out on the open storm water system, it was designed to accommodate a 15 year rainfall event as the baseline. The project involved retrofitting SUDS within existing development and infrastructure, and with residents in situ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completed stormwater management system includes a total of 6km of canals and water channels and ten retention ponds. Rainfall is collected in natural ditches and reservoirs before directing it into a conventional sewer system. The rainwater from roofs, roads and car parks is channelled through visible trenches, ditches, ponds and wetlands. These landscape features are integrated into the townscape within 30 courtyard areas, which also provide recreational green spaces for the area’s residents. Whilst green spaces were increased in size and number, the specific style of the 1950’s was maintained so as not to compromise the aesthetics of the area. Some of the green spaces can be temporarily flooded, which helps to manage water by slowing its entry into the conventional storm water system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, green roofs have been installed on all developments built post 1998. Some buildings existing prior to 1998, such as garages that have been reused as offices, have also been fitted with green roofs. Altogether, there are 30 green roofs in the neighbourhood and 2,100 square meters of green roofs are provided on houses. In addition, a Botanical Roof Garden, which covers 9,500 square meters of an old industrial roof, was developed between 1999 and 2001, and remains the largest green roof in Scandinavia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the implementation of the initiative, there have not been any floods in the area since the open stormwater system was installed. Moreover, a 50 year rainfall event was experienced in the summer of 2007, which cut most of Malmö off from rest of Sweden. Augustenborg was not affected by this event, suggesting the design of the storm water system is performing better than conventional design standards and that Augustenborg is well prepared for more intense rainfall events in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that 90% of the stormwater from roofs and other impervious surfaces is led into the open storm-water system. In addition, the total annual runoff volume is reduced by about 20% compared to the conventional system. This is due to evapotranspiration from channels and retention ponds between the rain events. Also, the runoff peak flows are delayed and attenuated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of an open stormwater system at Augustenborg has improved not only stormwater management in the area, but also the performance of the combined sewer system that serves the surrounding area. The volume of stormwater draining into the combined system is now negligible, and this system now drains almost only wastewater.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The alternative option of reducing flooding via a conventional separated stormwater system for Augustenborg would have meant major earthworks. This approach could also have caused problems further along the stormwater drainage network, such as bottlenecks where the system joins with older pipes. Moreover, the receiving areas could have suffered increased flood risk, erosion or water quality degradation. Therefore, the implementation of the open stormwater system described above was considered to be the most sustainable option aligning with the vision of the regeneration initiative Ekostaden Augustenborg.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The key actors involved in the regeneration of Augustenborg were the MKB housing company and the City of Malmö, represented by the Fosie district and the Service Department. However, several individuals were particularly important to the success of the project. The process of creation of Ekostaden Augustenborg began in 1997, and was started by discussions about closing down a nearby industrial area. Peter Lindhqvist from The Service Department, City of Malmö, suggested that an eco-friendly industrial park opened in the area. At the same time Bertil Nilsson, former headmaster at the school in Augustenborg, had become one of the co-ordinators of the Swedish Urban Program in Malmö. He contacted Christer Sandgren at MKB who was their housing manager for Augustenborg and had the mission to renew the area. The three men gathered a group of senior officers, colleagues and active residents in the area who all wanted to turn the area into a sustainable district of Malmö. A project leader, Trevor Graham with experience from Groundwork in England, was hired in 1998. As the project progressed, local businesses, schools and the industrial estate became involved.  The Botanical Roof Garden was developed in a partnership with several universities and private companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main objectives of Ekostaden Augustenborg was to enable residents to play a significant role in the planning and implementation of the initiative. The Augustenborg project incorporated extensive public consultation. This included regular meetings, community workshops, and informal gatherings at sports and cultural events. The approach became increasingly open and consultative. Approximately one fifth of the tenants in the area have participated in dialogue meetings about the project, and some have become very active in the development of the area. Augustenborg school pupils were involved in a number of local developments, for example with the planning of a rainwater collection pond which is adaptable to an ice rink.Constant communication and in-depth community involvement enabled the project to accommodate residents’ concerns and preferences regarding the design of the stormwater system. Consequently, the project encountered little opposition.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges to implementation of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) in Augustenborg:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Finding physical space to incorporate the SUDS into the already existing development: (i) the SUDS had to be fitted around existing electricity, water, heating and telephone infrastructure;  (ii) access for emergency vehicles had to be maintained; (iii) many residents were concerned that large percentage of the accessible green space was not suitable for recreation, and that some trees were removed.</li>
<li>Buildings could not be damaged by water. Thus, all SUDS were underlain with geotextile, removing the possibility for increased deep percolation and limiting the system’s function to water retention rather than infiltration.</li>
<li>Health and safety issues had to be solved. The SUDS were located within and in close proximity to school grounds, and concerns were raised about the drainage channels posing obstacles to elderly and disabled.</li>
<li>Other problems associated with the project were the unavoidable noise and dust during construction, which caused complaints from local residents. In addition, the retention ponds were prone to algae growth, and a technical solution was designed to solve this problem.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Success factors:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The initiative and enthusiasm of the Service Department in Malmö and housing company MKB; strong leadership by individuals from these organisations and their professional networks allowed development of the comprehensive project. In turn, this leadership was only possible due to decentralisation of power from the city to the district level.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The collaborative character of the project enabled joint management of the project.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Involvement of the residents in the design phase meant that there was little opposition to the project, and resulted in sense of ownership, empowerment and raised awareness among the residents.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Extensive funding provided by the local authorities and the housing company was another success factor.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The total sum invested in the physical improvements in Augustenborg and related projects was around SEK 200M (~€24M). Around half of the sum was invested by the housing company MKB. SEK 24M came from the Swedish national government within the LIP programme, and SEK 6M for building the Botanical Roof Garden came from the EU LIFE fond. Remaining funding mainly came from the local authorities, principally the City of Malmö. Management work is jointly funded through the housing company, which incorporates costs into rents, the water board through the water rates, and the city council’s standard maintenance budgets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a range of benefits additional to adaptation to more extreme rainfall events that stem from the comprehensive regeneration of the Augustenborg area:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">Reconfiguration of public spaces between housing blocks has given residents opportunities to grow their own food in small allotments, and has created places for leisure and attractive areas for children to play.</div>
</li>
</ul><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">Biodiversity in the area has increased by 50%. The green roofs, predominantly the Botanical Roof Garden, have attracted birds and insects, and the open storm water system provides better environment for the local plants and wildlife. In addition, flowering perennials, native trees and fruit trees were planted, and bat and bird boxes were installed.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">The environmental impact of the area (measured as carbon emissions and waste generation) decreased by 20%.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">The participatory character of the project sparked interest in renewable energy and in sustainable transport among residents, after they heard about similar plans for other areas.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;">Between 1998 and 2002 the following social changes have occurred: (i) turnover of tenancies decreased by 50%, (ii) unemployment fell from 30% to 6% (to Malmö’s average), (iii) participation in elections increased from 54 % to 79%.</div>
</li>
</ul><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: justify;">As a direct result of the project, three new local companies have started: Watreco AB (set up by local resident and amateur water enthusiast), the Green Roof Institute, and the car pool established in 2000, which uses ethanol hybrid cars to further reduce environmental impacts.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Climate-Proofing Social Housing Landscapes – Groundwork London and Hammersmith  Fulham Council]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Groundwork London – an environmental regeneration charity part of the Groundwork federation - in partnership with Hammersmith and Fulham Council, received LIFE+ funding for the Climate-Proofing Social Housing Landscapes project in 2013. The project, which came to an end in September 2016, has demonstrated an integrated approach to climate adaptation in urban areas by undertaking a package of affordable, light-engineering climate change adaptation measures based around the retrofitting of blue and green infrastructure. Alongside this, the project has also featured in-depth community engagement and awareness-raising of climate change adaptation opportunities, as well as training local apprentices and local authority staff in the skills to implement and maintain such measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These measures have been implemented in three different social housing contexts in West London, within areas characterised by high levels of multiple deprivation including higher exposure to climate-related risks. Ultimately, the project aimed to demonstrate an integrated approach to addressing climate-related and wider socio-economic challenges in vulnerable urban environments.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate scientists predict that climate change is likely to mean more extreme weather events across Europe, including winter flooding and summer heat waves. Climate change significantly increases the threat of surface water flooding in urban areas with high soil sealing, drainage systems already at or near capacity, and an increasing number of intensive rainfall events. According to the European Environment Agency, this is likely to be a particular problem for cities in north-west and northern Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social housing residents are typically more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, often living in urban environments that are subject to an increased risk of surface water flooding and the urban heat island effect. This is because when land is developed, soil sealing reduces the amount of water that is absorbed into the ground through natural drainage. Surface water flooding can cause substantial damage, disruption and costs to these communities. In the UK, for example, flood damage costs an estimated £1.1 billion per year, and over 5.2 million (one in six) properties in England are at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea, or surface water. Furthermore, in urban areas the capacity for heat storage is increased by the mass of construction material, and the reduction in vegetated surfaces compared to rural areas means that the potential for evaporative cooling is reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, vulnerable communities are also the least likely to be able to afford measures which could help them tackle this risk. Whilst most new developments are now designed with the flexibility to adapt to future climates, with the rate of renewal of the EU’s urban environment at less than 1% per annum, there is a huge gap in terms of existing housing that was not designed to withstand such changes. Therefore, European countries, and the cities in which many of their citizens live, need to prepare and adapt in order to future-proof existing buildings and infrastructure, minimising the impact extreme weather events will have on both the environment and on people's lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite marked differences between populations, fiscal and political environments and methods of provision, there are a number of challenges relating to social housing which are shared across Europe – not least the need to maintain and improve the quality of the building stock and its surrounding environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across Europe, considerable investment is being made by social landlords in housing repairs and maintenance; the retrofitting of housing stock has become part of landlords’ responsibility for improving their tenants’ quality of life and the energy efficiency of their stock. However, a 2011 survey by Housing Europe (formerly CECODHAS) found that only 10% of social housing landlords were actively implementing adaptation measures in their outdoor spaces. Given the importance of both the building stock itself and the surrounding open spaces in ensuring that social housing is able to withstand the impacts of a changing climate, this demonstrates a clear missed opportunity.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The key objectives of the project were to:</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Develop a transferable methodology for designing affordable, light-engineering climate change adaptation measures for social housing landscapes using green and blue infrastructure.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Design and implement comprehensive packages of retrofitting measures in three different types of social housing landscapes.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Implement the main measures through employment programmes for long-term unemployed beneficiaries creating local jobs.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop a set of training modules for housing and grounds maintenance professionals on the whole cycle of adaptation and green infrastructure relevant procurement systems, design, retrofit and maintenance.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop a transferable methodology for resident stakeholder engagement, resulting in site-specific community adaptation action plans and practical involvement in retrofitting and maintenance activities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Design an evaluation methodology capturing technical performance and social return on investment.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop interactive e-learning materials including a film to inform local, national and EU policy, strategy and best practice.</li>
</ol>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Climate-Proofing Social Housing Landscapes project sought to deliver a holistic package of climate change adaptation solutions in three social housing estates within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. Through the project, various highly effective, affordable and socially acceptable green and blue infrastructure interventions have been implemented in all three estates. The aim was to improve the overall quality of these urban environments, addressing climate threats such as flood risk, water scarcity and overheating, and wider contributors to local environmental quality such as biodiversity, air quality and water quality. The implemented measures are light-engineering solutions, including small basins, rain gardens, and green roofs. Soft landscaping elements have been implemented through accredited apprenticeship and employment programmes for local people as part of Groundwork London’s Green Teams, many of whom have been out of work for long periods of time, therefore creating local jobs. Hard landscaping elements have been delivered by externally appointed contractors. In this way, different mechanisms for resourcing the delivery of adaptation measures have been demonstrated. Specific interventions at each site are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Queen Caroline Estate:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Low-level green roofs</li>
<li>Rain gardens</li>
<li>Swales and basins</li>
<li>Schotterasen (Austrian gravel lawn)</li>
<li>Food growing beds</li>
<li>Tree and shrub planting</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Cyril Thatcher, Eric MacDonald and Richard Knight Houses:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Residential and low-level green roofs</li>
<li>Rain garden combined with tree pit</li>
<li>Swale</li>
<li>Food growing beds</li>
<li>Tree and shrub planting</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Cheeseman’s Terrace:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Low-level green roof</li>
<li>Rain gardens</li>
<li>Grassy basins</li>
<li>Permeable paving</li>
<li>Shrub planting</li>
<li>Resident planting/gardening areas</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to raise awareness, promote the benefits of such measures, and ensure that they are properly managed, a series of training modules has been developed and delivered for housing professionals and grounds maintenance contractors, supporting them through the full process from planning through to procurement, implementation and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents on the three estates have also been closely engaged throughout the project, raising their awareness of, and support for, the measures being implemented. As well as being informed of project progress through regular communications and events, they have also been actively involved in the design process and will continue to participate in the long-term maintenance of the installed measures. Residents on all three estates have been given the opportunity to become Sustainability Champions, with free training to equip them with the skills and understanding to manage their green space assets effectively. To support their on-going involvement in the initiative, residents have also been given training on the maintenance of certain measures, such as food growing beds. Some residents have also attended maintenance handover sessions with contractors so that they are informed of the maintenance activities that contractors are responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has sought to provide an evidence base that makes the business case for cross-cutting investment in green and blue infrastructure for social housing, by demonstrating its cost effectiveness and value for money through the environmental, social and economic benefits it offers. With this aim in mind, an evaluation methodology was established in order to monitor both the technical performance of the measures and their social and environmental value, with the University of East London appointed for the technical monitoring elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through all of the above, the project aimed to develop a methodology that would be applicable and transferable to other housing estates, not only within the UK but also across Europe. Various resources have been developed in order to share learning from the project, including an Implementation Guide, training materials, a Layman’s Guide, project film and 360<sup>o</sup> virtual tour. These are available on the project’s dedicated <a href="http://www.urbanclimateproofing.london/">website</a>.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has been led by environmental regeneration charity Groundwork London, working closely with Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council – the local authority and owner of the social housing estates in focus. The project demonstrated a holistic approach, with multiple teams working together to ensure its successful delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Groundwork London delivered the programme through a multi-disciplinary team experienced in joining up diverse activities from community engagement to digital marketing and from landscape design to employment advice and improving people’s skills. The organisation employs formally qualified community development officers, landscape architects, employment &#38; training specialists and communications, contract management and finance staff who were involved in both managing and delivering the project successfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is one of the 32 London Boroughs and has a population of circa 182,500. Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council is responsible for the delivery of services including education, social services, planning, waste disposal, recycling and collection, trading standards, emergency planning, roads, highways and transportation, housing, environmental health and parks and open spaces. In this project, the Housing Department’s Estate Services Unit acted as the Council’s project lead and also facilitated input from all other relevant Departments, including Environment and Finance teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents were key external stakeholders in the project, closely engaged throughout in order to secure their support for the interventions and giving them the opportunity to shape the open space improvements on their estates. This was done through meetings with Tenant and Resident Associations, as well as engagement with the wider resident population through events, door knocking and activities such as gardening groups. This engagement helped to promote greater awareness of the implications of climate change for London, and the actions that residents can take themselves to contribute to adaptation and resilience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other external stakeholders were engaged in both the delivery of the project and as expert advisers. This included green infrastructure specialists, monitoring and evaluation experts (the Sustainability Research Institute at the University of East London), the Landscape Institute, National Housing Federation, Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), London Climate Change Partnership, Natural England, Environment Agency, Thames Water, Greater London Authority and CIRIA.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has helped to demonstrate that:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Retrofitting open spaces in social housing environments is both necessary and cost-effective: affordable and socially acceptable light-engineering climate adaptation measures implemented through the project help to demonstrate the role these spaces can play in increasing urban resilience to climate change.</li>
<li>Such projects work better when not delivered in isolation: climate adaptation is multi-faceted and requires cross-disciplinary working – from consultation to co-design, from community engagement activities to training and employment opportunities.</li>
<li>Communities, in particular residents, are expert users of spaces and have valuable knowledge of their local environment: their involvement from the start of the project has been essential to secure their input and support.</li>
<li>A comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluation can help make the business case for such schemes: as exemplified by this project, this should not only include technical monitoring of the environmental benefits, but also additional evaluation to capture the wider social and economic benefits of the project.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">There were no major limiting factors to the project. Small challenges were addressed as they emerged, including:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It was hard to engage some estate residents in the climate change agenda at first as it wasn’t seen as an immediate problem for the estates. The project overcame this by linking wider threats to local issues, such as water pooling and overheating.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Several open spaces on the estates were fenced off and rarely used before the work started. Some residents were concerned that opening up the spaces might encourage anti-social behaviour. In reality, the opposite has happened, with the spaces now more widely used and valued.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Even with utility company drawings and radar surveys for underground services, not all services were identified. This meant some design changes were needed during construction.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Construction works close to residents’ homes and altering access routes were a concern for some residents. This was expected and managed through Groundwork London’s Community Projects Officer and relevant council teams.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The scheduling of works at the final estate reduced the time available for monitoring. This was solved by using storm simulation tests which allow for spot testing of the performance of interventions. The aim is to extend the monitoring period by up to a year (subject to funding) to better understand the longer-term performance of the SuDS (Sustainable Drainage Systems) measures.</li>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures of this nature are to a certain extent covered by European policy under the Water Framework Directive and the EU Floods Directive. These measures also demonstrate practical responses in line with the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, which encourages all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies and recognises that it makes sense to begin with measures that are low-cost, flexible and good for both the economy and the climate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A key relevant policy document is the European Commission’s Green Infrastructure Strategy, which recognises the important role these measures play in a number of areas, including the provision of ecosystem services, the protection and enhancement of natural capital, adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management, as well as offering health and social benefits too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the national level, the project has contributed to the development of the UK’s approach towards Sustainable Drainage Systems, inputting to a Defra/CLG consultation in 2014. At the regional level, the project is highly relevant for the London Sustainable Drainage Action Plan, which aims to ensure that London can manage its rainwater sustainably to reduce flood risk and improve water security, and is referred to in the Plan. The project has also helped to strengthen local planning policies associated with SuDS and climate change proofing of future developments within Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council’s new Local Plan, and is also feeding into the new Ecology / Biodiversity Policy that the local authority is proposing.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[The economics of managing heavy rains and stormwater in Copenhagen – The Cloudburst Management Plan]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To combat the impacts of cloudbursts, the City of Copenhagen developed a Cloudburst Management Plan in 2012, which is an offshoot of the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation Plan. The Plan outlines the priorities and measures recommended for climate adaptation including extreme rainfall. The City carried out an overall assessment of the costs of different measures (traditional vs different options including adaptation measures), the cost of the damages despite the measures and resulting financial impact. It was showed that continuing to focus on traditional sewage systems would result in a negative societal gain: despite capital investments, financial damages from flooding would remain high and not justify the high investment in measure implementation. On the other hand, the combined solution (including adaptation) would result in a net saving. The chosen combined solution will consist of expanding the sewer network and around 300 surface projects focusing on water retention and drainage.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Copenhagen has experienced four major rainfall events in the past six years. The largest, in 2011, caused damage totalling more than DKK 6bn. This does not include direct costs of repairing municipal infrastructure or indirect costs such as loss of earnings, loss of business operation, rising insurance premiums or companies choosing to move away from the City of Copenhagen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation Plan, a primary challenge for Copenhagen in light of climate change is more and heavier downpours in the future. Precipitation is expected to increase, while at the same time rain events will decrease, resulting in more intense rain events and subsequent flooding. Using the IPCC projections under the A2 scenario, the Danish Meteorological Institute projects that there will be 25-55% more precipitation in the winter months in 2100, with decreasing events in the summer by 0-40%. At the same time, the intensity of heavy rainfall could rise by 20-50%. The Adaptation Plan points out that the intensity of rain with a 10 year return will increase around 30% by 2100, a change that would overwhelm existing sewage and runoff systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An economic assessment of the costs of damage to Copenhagen if nothing is done to adapt the current runoff and sewage system is estimated around DKK 16bn over 100 years. Up to DKK 9 billion of this sum has already been “used up” in the recent major rainfall events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MIKE Urban, a mathematical runoff model, was used to analyse existing conditions and project the impact of climate change on floods in Copenhagen. Multiple scenarios were assessed using the timescales 2010 (as the baseline), 2060 and 2110 and looking at the frequency of the future flood events (10, 20, 100 years) and whether climate adaptation measures are implemented or not. The results of the calculations are presented as vulnerability maps showing the variation in water depth for the flooded areas. The results of the model simulations for 2060 show that 10-year rain events would flood an area greater than in 2010 (58 versus 48 hectares) but that the implementation of new measures would minimise floods occurring due to 100-year rain events. The results of the scenario in 2110 looked at 100-year rain events and the differences in flooding with or without climate adaptation. With no adaptation, 742 hectares of the city would be flooded, with adaptation only 235 hectares would be affected.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the Cloudburst Management Plan is to reduce the impacts of pluvial flooding due to heavy rains, which are expected to increase in frequency as a result of climate change. The plan builds on a detailed socio-economic assessment to ascertain whether cloudburst and stormwater management can pay off for society as a whole. Previously, sewer discharge was allowed to ground level once every 10 years. With the new management plan, sewer discharge will still be only allowed to reach ground level once every 10 years, but average water levels will lonely be allowed to exceed ground level by 10 cm once every 100 years (except areas designated for flood control).</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Copenhagen has neither the capacity nor the economy resources to implement all measures at once. The Cloudburst Management Plan operates with a minimum time frame of 20 years, requiring a prioritisation of individual projects in line with the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation Plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pluvial flood risk will be addressed through adaptive measures to store or drain excess water at ground level, such as reopening streams, constructing new canals or establishing lakes and more green spaces, and using roads with high kerbstones to lead the pluvial flood water into these. In addition, in the most densely built-up area of central Copenhagen, the water can be diverted to the harbour through large pipes. In particular, the Cloudburst Management Plan consists of four surface solutions as well as pipe-based solutions, including:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Stormwater roads and pipes that transport water towards lakes and the harbour;</li>
<li>Detention roads for storing waters;</li>
<li>Detention areas to store very large volume of waters, e.g. parks that could turn into lakes during flood events;</li>
<li>Green roads to detain and hold back water in smaller side streets.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">300 projects are planned and the City will decide once a year which projects will be undertaken through a prioritisation selection, considering:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>High risk areas: In connection with the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation Plan, a risk analysis was prepared. The results were presented as a risk map pinpointing the city areas with the highest risk of flooding (expressed in DKK) and, consequently, where adaptive measures would have the biggest effect.</li>
<li>Areas where measures are easy to implement: Areas where, by applying relatively simple measures, pluvial flood water can be drained to localities where it will not impact. These would be areas close to the harbour such as Ny Kongensgade and Ved Stranden where pluvial flood projects were carried out in 2012 to protect the areas against flooding by making openings in the quay thereby allowing the rainwater to drain into the harbour.</li>
<li>Areas with ongoing urban development projects: The costs of pluvial flood projects can often be reduced considerably if they are implemented in conjunction with renovation projects and new urban development projects (e.g. road renovation).</li>
<li>Areas where synergistic effects can be gained, e.g. by combining flood risk initiatives with those of other urban schemes such as local authority water directives.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that around 15 projects a year will be carried out in the next 20-30 years. In addition to the prioritisation of projects in terms of importance for flood prevention, a socio-economic assessment was undertaken. The assessment consists of:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>An assessment of the risk of flooding in the event of more rain and torrential downpours as well as the costs of damage it can cause over the next 100 years if we do nothing (“business as usual”).</li>
<li>A calculation of construction and operating costs in the traditional solution (sewers) and the combined alternative solution.</li>
<li>A comparison of the costs in the two solutions and the gains in reducing damage in the city in relation to “business as usual” (cost-benefit analysis). This calculation provides an answer to the question as to whether the solutions are advantageous in relation to doing nothing (“business as usual”).</li>
<li>A comparison of the traditional solution and the alternative solution in relation to the specified service objectives (cost-effectiveness analysis), which provides an answer to the question as to what solution is most advantageous if there is a wish to meet the municipality’s service objectives.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The assessment took into account a net charge factor of 17% and a tax distortion loss of 20% within the estimated construction costs. Since the solutions are implemented gradually over 20 years, 1% is added per year in operating costs for the surface solutions and .5% per year for other solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assessment found that while both the traditional sewer solution and the alternative solution meet the municipality’s objectives concerning stormwater and cloudbursts, the alternative solution results in higher net benefits. The traditional sewer solution has been estimated to cost DKK 20 billion compared to the DKK 13 billion of the alternative solution. Both solutions would reduce the costs of damage by DKK 16 billion; thus, the net gain of the alternative solution is DKK 3 billion compared to the net loss of the traditional solution of DKK 4 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To illustrate the uncertainties in the economic assessment, a supplementary calculation was made of the alternative based on the Finance Ministry’s guidelines from 2013 concerning socio-economic discounting. The calculation shows that the total damage rises from DKK 16 billion to DKK 18 billion over 100 years and that the net gain also rises from DKK 3 billion to DKK 5 billion. This result is due in particular to the Ministry of Finance’s discounting attributing greater weight to reductions in damage further in the future.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cloudburst Management Plan developed by the City of Copenhagen was coordinated with Køben-havns Energi (Copenhagen Energy), the City of Frederiksberg, and Frederiksberg Forsyning (Frederiksberg utility company), since all rainwater falling in Frederiksberg during an extreme rainfall event leads to either a sewage treatment plant or into the sea via the City of Copenhagen. Furthermore, collaboration was initiated with neighbouring local authorities who lead surface water and waste water through the city to the common sewage treatment plants or to common water courses and lakes.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of challenges to implementing the projects in the Cloudburst Management Plan have been identified:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Projects will need to be carried out on private roads. 132 km of private roads (around 30%) have been included in the plan, and road-owners can decide whether projects will be implemented. It may be necessary to purchase roads considered crucial to the management (currently 9km of roads have been identified).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The plan may impact conservation goals. An initial analysis of the environmental impact of the plan has taken place and there is a possibility to get exemptions from the Conservation Board in a couple areas.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The prioritisation of the projects emphasizes large-scale projects, which will require cooperation between municipalities and also private land owners.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Stormwater will need to be treated to ensure a proper water quality; solutions are being tested.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction economics is calculated in relation to what it would cost to establish a system for cloudburst and stormwater management in Copenhagen if it was built tomorrow. The total estimate of construction costs consequently differs from socio-economic costs by measures where the costs are calculated in terms of present-day value over a longer timeframe with a supplement of 37% in charges and tax distortion. The construction estimate contains 20% for project planning and 20% for unforeseen expenses. The estimate does not contain depreciation and operating costs. It will cost DKK 11bn at 2015 prices to construct the combined solution:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Surface solutions will cost an estimated DKK 4.975 billion. The costs of municipal and the private co-financing projects will be reimbursed through water charges.</li>
<li>Cloudburst pipes will cost an estimated DKK 2.66 billion, covered through water charges (HOFOR).</li>
<li>Disconnection and connection outside property boundary will cost around DKK 1 billion, covered through water charges (HOFOR).</li>
<li>Protection of homes with anti-flood backwater valves and disconnection within property boundary is estimated at around DKK 2.4 billion, financed by landowners.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The option of urban space improvements will cost around DKK 1 billion and will be financed by the City of Copenhagen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The estimate covers the total costs incurred by the City of Copenhagen, Capital Area Supply Company (HOFOR) and private landowners. The utility companies Frederiksberg Forsyning and Nordvand are part of the solution in Copenhagen because cloudburst management in these municipalities are dependent on the Copenhagen solution and vice versa. If these utilities contribute DKK 900 million, the construction estimate of the combined solution amounts to DKK 12 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The part of the combined solution concerned solely with managing water (hydraulic function) can be financed through the water charges. Water charges will increase to cover these costs. It has been estimated that the water charge of a household consuming 110 cubic meters water annually would increase by an average of DKK 890 per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The combined solution additionally necessitates private individuals to invest in anti-flood backflow valves etc. and local drainage of stormwater. If the implementation of the cloudburst and stormwater management is coordinated with other construction projects in the city, up to DKK 1 billion can be saved over the whole implementation period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cloudburst management plan will contribute to rises in property values and increased employment. It is estimated that the urban space improvements with recreational value will increase property prices in Copenhagen of just under DKK 1.4 billion. The upgrading of urban spaces can also increase revenue from property tax due to a significant increase in the value of those properties that are adjacent to the parks. Over 100 years, this extra revenue will amount to a value in present-day prices of DKK 1 billion. However, the equalisation system at present is structured in such a way that 66% of property tax revenue in Copenhagen is included in the equalisation and consequently goes to other municipalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Total employment of more than 13,000 full-time equivalents with DKK 1.6bn in tax revenues can be created in the construction phase. The tax revenue created as a result of additional employment in the building and construction industry always accrues to the municipality in which the employee is resident. It has therefore not been possible to calculate the effect in the City of Copenhagen alone. If the construction of facilities for urban space improvements is additionally included, the number of new full-time equivalents will rise to more than 15,000 and tax revenues to around DKK 2bn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assessment shows that under present-day circumstances we can expect an overall benefit of DKK 5bn from the combined solution in Copenhagen in comparison to a situation in which the City does nothing. The socio-economic benefit by choosing the combined solution compared to the traditional sewer solution is around DKK 9bn. The socio-economic assessment makes a comparison of the costs of the two solutions and benefits to be made from reducing damage in the city in comparison with the business as usual approach, as well as analyses the cost-effectiveness for addressing stormwater concerns.</p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Present legislation on the environment and waste water does not provide sufficiently for the optimal handling of increasing quantities of pluvial flood water seen from an environmental and financial perspective. The City of Copenhagen has, therefore, tabled a number of proposals for amendments to be considered by the Danish Ministry of the Environment. City of Copenhagen proposals for amendments primarily concern amendments regarding payment rules relating to waste water and the Planning Act in Denmark. Existing legislation obstructs the implementation of measures where existing roads will be used as flood ways for pluvial flood water. This is because the utility companies are only allowed to finance projects relating directly to waste water handling. A flood risk solution where roads, for example, were to be used to drain pluvial flood water cannot, with the present legislation, be financed by revenues from charges. If Københavns Energi (Copenhagen Energy) and Frederiksberg Forsyning (utility company) are to implement these measures, it will be necessary to designate the roads, in part, as waste water plants. This, however, is not feasible with the present Payments Act, Roads Act, and Environmental Protection Act.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Green roofs in Basel, Switzerland: combining mitigation and adaptation measures]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The city of Basel in Switzerland has the largest area of green roofs per capita in the world. Initiatives aiming to increase the provision of green roofs in Basel were initially driven by energy-saving programmes, and subsequently by biodiversity conservation. The City of Basel has promoted green roofs via investment in incentive programmes, which provided subsidies for green roof installation (1996-1997 and 2005-2006). The programmes were funded from the Energy Saving Fund made of 5% of all customers’ energy bills in the Basel canton. In 2002, an amendment to the City of Basel’s Building and Construction Law was passed. It reads that all new and renovated flat roofs must be greened and also stipulates associated design guidelines. This is likely to bring adaptation benefits in the form of lower temperatures and reduced surface runoff.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1970 and 2007, 1.5ºC temperature increase was observed in Switzerland. In comparison to the beginning of the 20th century, the frequency of intense rainstorms north of the Alps has increased by between 15 to 70% depending on location. Future climate projections suggest that by 2050s the temperature in Switzerland north of the Alps could increase by 2ºC in winter and 2.5ºC in summer. By 2100, under a high greenhouse emissions scenario, the temperature is projected to increase by about 4.5 ºC in comparison to the 1990s. This means that every second summer will be as hot or even hotter than the temperatures reached during the 2003 heat wave which caused severe loss of life across Europe. Extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in frequency and severity. Green roofs were found to offer opportunities to combine energy saving, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity objectives.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main aim of the green roof initiative is to increase the coverage of green roofs in the city of Basel through the use of a combination of financial incentives and building regulations. Reducing energy consumption of buildings and protection of biodiversity have been the initial key motivators. Initially, green roofs, as a measure of energy saving, were funded by the City of Basel for a two-year period in the mid-1990s to stimulate interest and awareness. Encouraged by the success of this project, funds were allocated for a study documenting the biodiversity benefits of green roofs. It is now recognised that green roofs also provide a climate change adaptation function through limiting surface water runoff and reducing temperature in urban areas.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In many cities of Switzerland, green roofs became popular in the 1970’s as an element of ecological construction. Numerous green roofs were created in the 1980s, mainly as pilot projects, which provided a foundation of knowledge and experience for later initiatives. In addition, 1995 was the EU year of Nature Conservation. This provided the impetus for Basel’s first green roof campaign, which started in 1996. In the early 1990’s the City of Basel implemented a law to support energy saving measures. According to this law, which was the only one of its type in Switzerland, 5% of all customers’ energy bills are put into an Energy Saving Fund, which is then used to fund energy saving campaigns and measures. The national Department of Environment and Energy decided to pursue and promote green roofs using this source of funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In densely built-up areas where providing extensive parks and planting trees may be impossible, vegetated roofs are a feasible greening option. These roofs not only mitigate the urban heat island effect but also act as insulators. By minimising heat gains in buildings, they can lower the indoor temperatures by as much as 5°C and consequently reduce the need for cooling and the associated energy use, thus contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Modelling studies conducted in Manchester, UK show that greening all the suitable roofs in densely built-up areas could reduce storm water runoff by 17–20%. Green roofs can also provide ‘stepping stones’ for migratory species under changing climate conditions. As a result, an investigation of the total number of green roofs resulted in 1711 extensive green roof projects and 218 intensive green roofs in the city of Basel. So, approximately 23% of Basel’s flat roof area was green roof in 2006. For developers, installing green roofs is now considered routine, and developers make no objections to installing them. In Basel, the green roof regulations stipulate the following:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The growing medium should be native regional soils — the regulation recommends consulting a horticulturalist;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The growing medium should be at least 10 cm deep;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mounds 30 cm high and 3 m wide should be provided as habitat for invertebrates;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Vegetation should be a mix of native plant species, characteristic to Basel;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Green roofs on flat roofs over 1,000 square meters must involve consultation with the city’s green roof expert during design and construction.</li>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the first incentive programme (1996-1997), the Department of Environment and Energy conducted a poll with the Swiss public to determine the level of support for an electricity tax to pay for energy-saving measures. The focus on green roofs was promoted by the researchers from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Wädenswil, Switzerland, who worked to influence decision-makers in Basel to amend the building regulations and offer financial incentives to increase green roof coverage. Various stakeholders were consulted when developing the green roof concept, and in establishing the first incentive programme: the local business association, the horticultural association, the green roof association, the Pro Natura Basel environmental organization, the Department of Parks and Cemeteries in the City of Basel, and the National Department of Environment, Forest and Landscapes. Basel’s green roof regulations did not meet with any significant resistance because all stakeholders were involved in the process from the beginning, and due to the success of the incentive programmes. For developers, installing green roofs is now considered to be a routine practice, and developers make no objections to installing them. The incentive programmes were targeted at businesses as well as the residents of Basel. During the incentives programme in 1996-97, the media interest in was high, and newspapers and posters were used to inform residents of Basel about the subsidies. This played an important role in its success through increasing awareness of green roofs across a range of stakeholders. Contests on the best looking green roofs are organised regularly.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A comprehensive suite of mechanisms, from incentives to statutory regulations, has ensured a wide uptake of green roofs in Basel. Championship of the project by a committed researcher from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Stefan Brenneisen) contributed to the initiative’s success. Involvement of all stakeholders from the beginning of the initiative helped to address questions and concerns and ensured that everyone’s goals were met.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An important lesson is that in the urban context climate change adaptation can be compatible with mitigation; the case of Basel illustrates that adaptation can be driven by the actions aiming at energy saving and climate change mitigation. Such opportunities of utilising the existing and on-going urban and infrastructure developments driven by other goals for the purposes of adaptation should be sought and maximised in order to avoid maladaptation. Green roofs are an excellent example for this.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial costs of roof greening were estimated as CHF 100 per square meter. Beneficiaries of the fund received CHF 20 per square meter of green roof, for both new developments and for retrofitting green roofs to an existing building. In total, 135 residents and businesses applied for a green roof subsidy, which resulted in greening of 85,000 per square meter of roofs. The consequent energy savings for Basel were estimated at 4 GWh/year. No information is available as to whether the energy savings have achieved a return on the initial investment for the individual properties in Basel; however, according to some literature, green roofs tend to be 10–14% more expensive than traditional roofs over their lifespan due to their initial costs (the cost of maintaining extensive green roofs is similar to that for traditional roofs). Thus, a 20% reduction in green-roof construction cost (such as that achieved through the subsidy scheme) is sufficient to equalise the costs of green and traditional roofs for investors, which suggests that green roofs are not only a sustainable but also a financially feasible option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This even leaves out the fact that green roofs have additional multiple benefits, including absorbing rainwater and delaying runoff (hence reducing flood risk in high intensity rainfall events); providing insulation and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the urban heat island effect; creating a habitat for plant and wildlife; and providing a more aesthetically pleasing urban landscape.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Basel passed a Building and Construction Law requiring green roofs on all new developments with flat roofs. The Building and Construction Law has since provided a major impetus for more green roofs in Basel. An amendment, passed in 2002, reads that all new and renovated flat roofs must be greened and also stipulates their design to maximise the biodiversity.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Green roofs are private initiave that can be stimulated by the government. In Basel, two green roof incentive programmes operated for specified two year long periods (1996-1997 and 2005-06).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Climate resilient retrofit of a Rotterdam building]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The old office building at Groot Willemsplein, Rotterdam, dating back to the 1940’s, was renovated to give it a new life with commercial functions on the ground floor and flexible office spaces at the other floors. The most important climate adaptation and mitigation measure implemented is the energy-efficient cooling and heating system. An Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) system supplies the building with heat and cold. In summer, heat will be absorbed and stored in a ground water aquifer, this stored heat can be used in winter to heat the building. During the summer period cold water from another part of the aquifer is pumped up to cool the building. In this way the infrastructure is associated with climate adaptation (being prepared for increased cooling needs in summer in a sustainable way) and mitigation (reduced emissions of carbon dioxide). The additional heat that is needed comes from district heating (excess heat from nearby industry). The rooftop garden is a further implemented adaptation measure dampening the effect of more frequent heavy showers; in addition it is an attractive recreational green space with special attention for birds, bats and insects.</p>

    <field_sectors><![CDATA[BUILDINGS]]></field_sectors>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooling needs in summer are expected to increase as a consequence of higher temperatures due to climate changes. The main climate adaptation challenge was therefore the protection of the interior of the building from excess heat in this season. Proposed solutions to renovate the office building also aimed to create synergies between adaptation and mitigation solutions; the main climate mitigation challenge was to become highly energy efficient, thereby saving energy consumption.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective was to develop a sustainable and attractive office building that fits in the area, making use of the existing infrastructure as much as possible, and including synergic mitigation and adaptation solutions to climate change, in particular related to the building cooling system. Groot Willemsplein is a central location in Rotterdam that serves as an entrance to the city, a location for small events, and a hub for water transportation and is part of a green zone for recreational purposes. To guarantee a contribution to a lively area the ground floor of the building had to have a commercial function and could not be used as offices.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With regard to climate change adaptation, the use of an ATES (Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage) system and a green roof are the most important implemented solutions. In particular:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>ATES was used for cooling in summer and heating in winter. In summer, the cooling is fully dependent on ATES. For heating in winter, ATES contributes to 30-50% of the heat, for the remaining 50-70% use is made from the district heating system which uses excess heat from nearby industry. This was the most feasible solution for this building. The use of ATES has enabled an overall CO2 reduction of 11.4% with respect to district heating alone. When only the heating/cooling system is considered, the CO2 reduction is 45%, mainly due to more sustainable cooling in summer.</li>
<li>A rooftop garden serves as rain water buffer. In addition it is an attractive recreational area for people from the offices and it serves as a habitat for insects, birds and bats.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Other sustainable solutions not strictly related to climate change adaptation that were implemented in the renovation of the office building are highlighted in the following points:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The skeleton of the existing building was used as much as possible. The upper floor that was added later and the interior of the building were demolished, but the construction was maintained. In this way optimal use was made of the available material. The old building contributes 57% of the material volume of the new building.</li>
<li>The original construction was strong enough to be reused and, with modifications, to serve as a basis for the new construction with three extra floors in a lightweight construction.</li>
<li>Triple glazing of the new floors was used to reduce heat losses.</li>
<li>Transparent facades and an atrium give an optimal use of day light.</li>
<li>To make optimal use of the space, the offices of the main tenant contain flexible places to work in open offices, with spaces to retreat for phone calls and meetings. Sensors for day light and sensors for presence reduce the use of artificial lighting.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The result of all adopted measures together is that the energy consumption is 63% lower than the average office building in The Netherlands.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation was not directly relevant for the renovation of the office building. The following key actors are involved in the project. The company Joulz working in the field of gas and electricity infrastructure selected the building for its new headquarter offices. Joulz had explicit requirements for sustainability and currently is the main tenant, occupying the lower 3 office floors. LSI Project Investment, Rotterdam, was owner of the building and commissioned the renovation. Gemeente Rotterdam is not a formal stakeholder but required a commercial use of the ground floor which now includes a restaurant.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main tenant of the offices, Joulz company, initiated the process and explicitly wanted a sustainable building for their headquarters. Joulz was enthusiastic about the location of the building and saw the potential to transform it into a building that matches with its sustainable business goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although it is an old building, the project developers have made maximum use of the original infrastructure by upgrading the parts that can be kept and replacing the other parts by well-insulated alternatives. However, the decision to make use of the existing construction reduces the flexibility of the design of the building and therewith the possibilities to implement sustainability measures in a cost-efficient way.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Total costs of the whole project was 10 million Euro. The project was fully funded by a private company. ATES would cost 531.877 Euro as compared to 252.994 Euro for a conventional system, but saves 23.882 Euro per year. Moreover, there is a small refund of 10% on the investment costs for a sustainable installation. The investment in ATES would be returned in about 9.5 years.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Assessing adaptation challenges and increasing resilience at Heathrow airport]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, as all other large infrastructure providers in UK, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) was asked by the UK government to submit a climate change adaptation report (also called adaptation strategy). The report included a climate adaptation risk analysis matrix, which has been regularly monitored since then. Besides rain (and consequent flooding) and temperature, fog and changing wind directions were identified as the weather conditions deserving more attention today and also in the future. Weather conditions are not expected to impact significantly operations in the short (2020) and medium (2040) term; therefore, one of the conclusions of the adaptation report is that as far as near-term changes are concerned, HAL's resilience plans are fit for purpose. In 2013, the UK government invited HAL to submit a progress report, which was published in July 2016; in accordance with it, all the short-term actions foreseen in 2011 have been implemented.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The preparation of the adaptation report considered assets owned by HAL and involved a comprehensive risk assessment of climate related risks to the direct and indirect operations of Heathrow. The adopted approach was quantitative (where possible) incorporating climate modelling, literature review, and concerted consultation with HAL external partners. In particular climate modelling was undertaken for two time periods: the short term (i.e. now to 2020) and the medium to longer term (i.e. 2020 to the 2050s) considering high, medium and low emissions scenarios. Key uncertainties identified relate to the modelling of future climate change, future development of assets at Heathrow, indirect risks from third parties, as well as critical threshold levels for specific assets. The assessment addresses uncertainties by adopting a precautionary approach and classifying the uncertainty of risks identified. In the worst case scenario, the risk assessment has identified 34 risks in the short and medium to longer term. The main relevant climate variability refers to projected longer term changes to temperature and precipitation extremes, and uncertainties in prevailing wind conditions in the future. The latter are of particular concern, because the airport’s two runways are parallel and there is no crosswind runway.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the HAL adaptation report is to comply with the requirements of the UK Government, following the 2008 Climate Change Act. Since its submission in 2011, the implementation of the adaptation strategy is following good-practice principles such as: no-regrets, synergies, precautionary principle, flexibility, integration, knowledge-based, proportionality or sustainability. A successful adaptation of Heathrow would be measured by the airport ability to keep meeting its statutory functions and stakeholder needs, and fulfilling its organisational priorities.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Three classes of priority adaptation responses have been identified in the adaptation report: "action", "prepare" and "watching brief" responses:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Action: identifies response which is required in the short term, either to manage short term risks (classified as high) or because the solution to longer term risks needs to begin in the short term because of long planning or implementation cycles.</li>
<li>Prepare: identifies need for additional research and/or development prior to confirming any risk management actions.</li>
<li>Watching brief: risks are relevant in longer term and require an on-going watching brief to monitor science evolution and effects of climate change.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The first two classes have been delivered within the first three years (2012-2014). At the request of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), an operational resilience plan was prepared and submitted in 2014. The key points related to the operational resilience include the following:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>To have risk assessments for the infrastructure under its control and for all the services it offers at the airport, with clear management procedures and clear communication plans in place for remedying and dealing with the impact of the loss of infrastructure or service.</li>
<li>The process should include dissemination of information to passengers and some provision of passenger welfare if the airlines are slow to organise this.</li>
<li>All plans should be underpinned by robust business continuity models.</li>
<li>Allocation of capacity during disruption should be given the utmost focus, as at high-density airports such as Heathrow delays cannot be easily absorbed.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Heathrow has implemented a number of new technologies and processes in order to provide higher capacity and to increase its resilience to weather disruption. These measures provide adaptation responses under the "action" class identified in the adaptation report, which address challenges such as heavy rainfall events, changes to groundwater levels and increasing variability of snowfall:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>One way Heathrow is mitigating the impact of changes to wind is through time-based separation (TBS) procedures, which were introduced in March 2015. TBS uses real-time wind data to calculate the optimum safe time between arriving aircraft, allowing separation distances to be reduced to maintain the landing rate. TBS brings additional operational benefits in addition to providing future climate resilience to Heathrow.</li>
<li>New wake vortex separation rules (RECAT-EU). Another measure under consideration is reducing separations among aircrafts (and therefore increasing airport capacity) under certain particular crosswind conditions, in which the vortex is blown away.</li>
<li>Airfield flow management through Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB). DCB is able to predict the behaviour of flights and the effects of any actions taken by the airport to change the outcomes. In this way, the actual capacity of the airport can be estimated in advance with higher accuracy, taking into account the expected conditions of a wide range of variables, such as global winds or local weather, and the contingency measures to be adopted by the airport. Airfield flow is subsequently managed taking into account these conditions. DCB is expected to be implemented in 2018-2019.</li>
<li>Changes to low visibility procedures (LVP) to increase resilience to the impact of fog, through enhanced Instrument Landing Systems (eILS).</li>
<li>A GBP 37 million investment to improve resilience to snow (following lessons learnt in the 2010 snow event), including additional equipment, new processes for weather forecasting, enhanced command and control structure and a detailed Passenger Welfare Plan.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">These measures do not only have an effect in gaining resilience to weather disruption. As the climate change projections for Heathrow suggests higher variability in the future (e.g. for rain and snowfall), the measures implemented are also increasing medium and long-term climate resilience to the airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heathrow’s climate change risk assessment also examines how more extreme temperatures might affect the airport pavements in terms of deformation, bearing capacity and durability, although the risk from the effects of extreme temperature is low in the near to medium term. In the longer term (in 50 years or more) there may be more significant temperature increases, and a need to introduce alternative materials and performance requirements in pavement composition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using best available information on future climatic effects and applying a comprehensive risk assessment that took a precautionary worse case approach to future climate change risks, the adaptation report concluded that:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Heathrow has comprehensive control measures and contingency plans for managing climate related risks, and these are considered sufficient to manage climate change risks in the shorter term (e.g. to 2020).</li>
<li>It is not feasible at this time to conduct a detailed assessment of climate projections beyond the 2050s since this time scale falls outside typical airport planning cycles and the climate science becomes increasingly uncertain in the longer term.</li>
<li>Climate risks in the short term are predominantly low, and where risks are more significant these are already being managed through existing mitigation and resilience programmes.</li>
<li>Assuming no changes to existing control measures, the risks associated with climate change impacts in the medium to longer term are predicted to worsen.</li>
<li>Assuming the adaptation report is implemented and continually evolved will ensure that residual risks are appropriately managed.</li>
<li>Key adaptation responses identified in the short term generally build on existing actions planned by the business.</li>
<li>Delivery of the adaptation actions will be assured through clear ownership across Heathrow’s business units together with a requirement for on-going reporting of progress at senior health, safety and environment (HS&#38;E) performance management fora.</li>
<li>Regular review (5 yearly comprehensive and mid-point reviews) of the climate risk assessment will ensure continuous updating of the adaption report in line with best available information on climate science, risk thresholds and business and infrastructure planning cycles.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Short-term actions undertaken thus far have mainly addressed current climate variability, and they are opening the way for a more comprehensive, long-term approach to the challenges of climate change. Since 2011, adaptation to climate change has been mainstreamed in the main planning instruments of the airport. This includes the annual strategic capital business plan, which now is dedicating a specific section to resilience investments, the airport management system, which is following ISO14001:2015 guidance, including climate change adaptation, the annual operational resilience plan and a corporate risk process including the regular review of the 34 risks initially identified at the 2011 Adaptation Report.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The preparation of the adaptation report and its implementation is following a collaborative approach, with participation of professionals from the different technical services and companies involved in HAL operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Key external partners and regulators consulted through the preparation of the adaptation report included the Environment Agency, National Air Traffic Services (NationalS), London Borough of Hillingdon, Transport for London (TfL), surface transport operators, and key Heathrow airlines. Interdependencies have been identified where others’ actions are likely to impact on Heathrow’s ability to manage its own climate change risks. These relate primarily to provision of key utilities, aircraft fuel infrastructure, surface access services and infrastructure and airline operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The HAL climate adaptation report was submitted to the UK government and published after approval in May 2011. The information from the report was used in the National Adaptation Plan. Following the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK government asked HAL and other organizations to submit a progress report by 2016. These updates should feed the next national risk assessment of risks from climate change, due to be published no later than 2017.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This preparation of the adaptation report has been well received across the airport. Success factors include the involvement of professionals from the various services and companies involved in HAL operations; other success factors are related to the availability of well-developed climate change scenarios, and to the already deep reliance of operations and management on weather information. The actions identified offer a good benchmark for monitoring progress in delivering results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main limiting factors are due to the uncertainty in long-term climate models. Whilst there are some commonalities in terms of barriers to adaptation (i.e. scientific uncertainty), others are very much determined by an organisation’s own situation. For Heathrow Airport the main barriers to successful adaptation are summarised below:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Scientific uncertainty, regarding the pace and scale of climate change and particularly scientific uncertainty surrounding some variables not currently able to be modelled in a probabilistic fashion i.e. prevailing wind direction.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Financial uncertainties and resource constraints. The airport has to balance the need to invest in adaptation with other business investment priorities. Furthermore as a regulated company its return is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 5 year cycles that do not necessarily match the long term timescale challenges posed by climate change.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Uncertainty regarding future aviation industry developments: demand projections, destination trends, aviation technology changes and future development plans at the airport in the medium and longer term.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Space constraints. Heathrow’s footprint is comparatively compact when compared to other major hub airports around the world. Space constraints on the site do limit the storage of supplies onsite, and limit the ability of HAL to expand some infrastructure and assets which would improve adaptive capacity at the airport.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Runway capacity constraints. Heathrow is among the most congested airports in the world and the lack of spare capacity means that unlike many other British or European airport, HAL has very little room to manoeuvre when disruption occurs.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Permitting constraints. Heathrow’s activities are constrained by numerous permitting constraints reflecting the airport’s proximity to residential areas i.e. the night flight quota, Cranford Agreement, air quality and noise footprint limits. Some of these permitting constraints may affect the adaptation options available to the airport.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Interdependencies. As a landlord of many other organisations based at Heathrow, HAL is limited in how directly it can shape the adaptation undertaken by other organisations. Not all adaptation decisions will be taken in-house by HAL and the airport operator will be affected by the degree to which other bodies at the airport choose to adapt to climate change. Furthermore HAL relies on external, offsite third party organisations for some of its essential services i.e. fuel, staff transport, power, potable water and should climate change negatively impact these services then the adaptive capacity at Heathrow could be impaired.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Other legislative requirements. HAL’s adaptation response will need to be balanced with other regulatory requirements. Primary amongst these is the need to maintain airfield and aviation safety.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Any adaptation action following the strategy must be subject to a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main legal framework of this review is the Climate Change Adaptation Acts (2008), which provides a so-called Adaptation Reporting Power to the UK Government. Based on this, the government requested HAL, among many other infrastructures mangers, to provide an adaptation report by 2011, and to regularly update it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Climate Change Act (2008) created a legal framework for increasing the UK’s ability to respond and adapt to the consequences of climate change. An essential component of the Act and the Adapting to Climate Change (ACC) cross-Government programme is to lay before Parliament risk assessments of the threats and opportunities posed to the UK by the physical impacts of climate change on a five-yearly basis, with the first national risk assessment to be presented in January 2012. Organisations whose assets and functions are felt to be of national importance have been directed by Government to assess their vulnerability to the consequences of climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DEFRA identified the operators of Heathrow Airport as being of particular importance in adapting the UK to the changing climate, because of its importance to the national economy and to global transportation of people and cargo. Heathrow (amongst other UK strategically important airports) is considered within the ACC programme as a priority reporting authority and is part of the first tranche of organisations required to input into the National Climate Change Risk Assessment.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation report is updated every five years. The first revised report was submitted to the UK Government in July 2016. All the responses under the "action" category have been implemented, and studies have been undertaken for those under the "prepare" and "watching brief" categories. Heathrow’s climate change adaptation risk register is reviewed on a regular basis, assessing risk status and identifying new risks posed by climate change. There is also a regular review of progress in climate change science and new information. In particular the UK’s new set of climate change projections (UKCP18) will be revised, once they are published in 2018.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Securing future water supply on regional and local level in the River Lavant Valley, Carinthia]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The densely populated River Lavant valley region in the eastern part of Carinthia in the southern Austrian Alps is characterised by a low level of precipitation, geological conditions unfavourable to groundwater storage and a limited number of springs that can be used for water supply. In the past decades, annual precipitation amounts have declined significantly, and the region has been affected by water shortages during hot summers several times. Despite uncertainties in projections of future changes of regional precipitation patterns, the variability of groundwater levels and discharges of springs are expected to increase further in the future, raising the risk of water scarcity and temporal bottlenecks in water supply during drought periods. The region has responded to these challenges by adaptation measures to secure future water supply on the regional and local level, in particular by establishing a regional water association network interconnecting the supply networks of four municipalities, developing new water sources and investing in extension of the supply infrastructure. The municipalities are encouraging their citizens to use water sparingly and efficiently by providing information about water stress levels and raising awareness about water-saving measures.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The River Lavant valley is situated at the southern rim of the Alpine main ridge and is enclosed by the mountain ranges of the Saualpe in the west and the Koralm in the east, which are both ranging up to 2100 m. Wolfsberg, the district capital, and St. Andrä are the largest towns in the region. The springs in the two mountain ranges provide most of the drinking and service water for the municipalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The River Lavant valley is characterised by low precipitation amounts. With an average annual precipitation of less than 800 mm the valley is one of the driest regions of Carinthia. Moreover, the geological conditions are unfavourable to groundwater storage, the discharges of springs are rather low, and only a limited number of springs can be used for water supply. Due to these natural limitations in water availability, the region has already been affected by water shortages in the past decades, especially during hot and dry summers (<a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/alps-climate-change-and-adaptation-2009">EEA 2009</a>; <a href="https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/umwelt/klimaschutz/klimapolitik_national/anpassungsstrategie/goodpractice-broschuere.html">BMLFUW 2016</a>). Significant seasonal bottlenecks in water supply have occurred frequently, e.g., in the years 1993, 2002, 2003 and 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Effects of climate change have been noticeable in the region already during the last decades. Over the last 100 years, there is a clear trend of decreasing annual precipitation in most parts of Carinthia south of the Alpine main ridge. In the Lavant valley region, annual precipitation has decreased by approximately 15–25%, with the strongest seasonal decrease occurring in winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assumedly due to the location of Carinthia at the convergence of Mediterranean and Atlantic climatic influences, model-based regional projections of future trends in precipitation patterns in the south part of Austria have always been subject to high uncertainties and regularly exhibit pronounced variation between climate models. Previous regional scenarios of changes in annual precipitation have ranged from slightly positive to slightly negative trends. Some scenarios projected a significant decline of summer precipitation by up to -15 % from 2050 onwards. The most recent Climate Scenarios for Austria (ÖKS 15) indicate a significant increase in annual mean temperature of +1.3°C (climate mitigation scenario according to RCP4.5) to 1.5°C (business-as-usual scenario according to RCP8.5) for Carinthia and the Lavant Valley up to 2050 (compared to the period 1971-2000). By the end of the century an annual mean temperature increase of up to +4.2 °C may occur in a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5). The scenarios also show an increase in the annual number of heat days (days with &#62;30 °C). These could increase by +3.2 days by 2050 and rise up to +5.8 or even +17.1 days by the end of the century. As regards annual average precipitation, slight increases are projected in the medium- and long-term, which is mostly due to higher simulated precipitation amounts in the winter season, but all rainfall-related model results are lacking statistical significance. In contrast to temperature projections, future trends in precipitation continue to be characterised by considerably larger uncertainties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stronger variability in groundwater levels and deliveries of springs, culminating in recurring periods of water shortage, had been observed already in the years prior to initiation of the adaptation measures. Although the results of regional climate modelling are not straightforward to interpret in terms of their implications for groundwater stocks and groundwater renewal, it is expected that groundwater levels, aquifers and discharges of springs will be affected by increasing variability in the future. This outcome is likely to result from the combined effects of higher inter-annual variability in precipitation regimes, possible decreases in summer rainfall with prolonged periods of drought, higher evapotranspiration rates, and reduced groundwater recharge due to less snowfall and shorter duration of snow cover in winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reduced availability of water resources during dry and hot summer periods coincides with an increase in water demand by households, tourism and agriculture, which in the past has contributed to water supply problems. Since in the central areas of the Lavant valley region further growth in population and settlement areas is expected, this may raise overall water consumption, and thus increase the vulnerability of drinking water supply. Decreasing water availability combined with higher withdrawal rates during dry and hot summer periods were recognized as a threat to continuity of public water supply and created a strong need for response measures by the water management sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forests cover up to 50% of the region’s area, and in particular forest stands at mountain slopes fulfil important water retention functions and protective functions with regard to natural hazards. Due to extensive introduction in altitudes below 900 m in the past, Norway spruce is distributed far beyond its natural range and is by far the dominant tree species in the region. Since spruce trees prefer cool and wet sites, they have in many locations already reached the limits of their tolerance under current climate conditions. Climate-induced multiple stresses on these forests do not only result in productivity losses, but are also threatening their vitality, ecological stability and the delivery of important ecosystem services of forests, such as water retention, water storage, and the protection against gravitational natural hazards.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the adaptation measures was to secure water resources and the public water supply over the long term. The strategies pursued target both the supply and demand side of drinking water management. On the supply side, re-organising the water supply system on regional level, building new water supply infrastructure, and developing new water resources aim at safeguarding the continuity of quantitative public water supply even in periods of reduced natural water availability and peak consumption. A further objective is to guarantee the water supply, even if one of the local facilities should fail for any reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the demand side, an early warning system, information and awareness-raising measures aim at encouraging water-saving behaviour of citizens and households. These adaptation measures have mostly been taken in response to observed climate impacts and experienced water shortages, but they have also been motivated by unfavourable climate projections and reflect a preventive approach to the considerable uncertainties as regards future precipitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of further measures taken by the forest management sector is to reduce vulnerability of regional forests to climate change, such as water stress, heat intolerance, bark beetle infestations, and susceptibility to storm damage, and to maintain or improve the protective functions (flood retention, slope stabilisation) and water storage capacities of forest ecosystems.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main adaptation activities in the River Lavant valley focus on securing the public water supply. They are complemented by further measures to reduce water demand by influencing behavior of water users. Adaptation measures have been taken both on the inter-municipal, i.e. regional level, and on the local level of the individual municipalities. Implementation of the measures started as early as 1994; since then it has gradually extended and is an ongoing process. The following adaptation activities have so far proved successful to meet the challenges of climate-induced water shortages in the River Lavant valley region:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Establishment of the “regional water association network Lavant valley”, an organisational arrangement for regional water supply, starting in 1994. By interconnecting the water supply networks of the four municipalities of Wolfsberg, St. Andrä, St. Paul and St. Georgen, water shortages in each municipality can be compensated, peak consumption can be intercepted, and water supply risks are shared between municipalities and altogether reduced, including by providing infrastructural redundancies in case of system failures. Today, the water association network owns a transport system that can provide an annual discharge flow of 260,000 m³. The water comes from 12 springs on privately owned land; water withdrawal is secured by the water association network through long-term contracts. This strategy of risk management has proved successful for approximately 42,000 consumers connected to the public water supply system.</li>
<li>Establishing the water supply infrastructure of the network involved the development of new water resources within the region and installation of new transmission pipelines. Water is extracted from natural springs only, without using any pumping facilities. A central remote control system assures that only those amounts of water are extracted that are actually needed to sustain supply. Only in situations of peak demand, additional water is diverted into the supply system. Water from developed springs that is not needed to cover the demand is allowed to remain within the hydrological system and to flow into natural surface streams. These measures shall assure that impacts on the water balance of the natural environment are as low as possible.</li>
<li>Comprehensive infrastructural, organisational and planning measures have been taken also at the local level. In the town of Wolfsberg, new water sources, including deep groundwater wells, have been developed and connected to the public supply system. To limit water extraction from deep groundwater bodies, the respective wells are switched in only in extraordinary situations of demand-supply bottlenecks. The municipal supply infrastructure has been upgraded and currently encompasses 400 kilometers of supply lines, 83 springs, 29 high-level water tanks and 7 UV water treatment plants. To be prepared for situations of water shortage, a municipal crisis management plan has been prepared providing for measures such as continuous monitoring of water supply, connection to the regional water association network and on-demand connection of additional deep groundwater wells. A cooperation agreement with an extra-municipal water supplier allows to import additional drinking water, if this should be required (<a href="https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/umwelt/klimaschutz/klimapolitik_national/anpassungsstrategie/goodpractice-broschuere.html">BMLFUW 2016</a>).</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In parallel to adapting water supply management, the municipal water works of the region seek to manage the water demand by providing information about the drinking water supply situation and water-saving measures to their customers. The town of Wolfsberg has an early warning system in place and provides daily updated data about the drinking water situation on its website. Depending on the level of the early warning status, different water-saving measures are recommended. In situations of high water stress, regulatory measures enter into force, such as prohibitions of filling swimming pools, irrigating gardens and washing cars. Awareness raising about water management issues is also a regular focus of the municipal newspaper and other local media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures have also been put in place for forest management, which has already been negatively affected by climate change impacts. Silvicultural management aims to reduce the climate vulnerability of the region’s forests by promoting use of more drought-tolerant tree species and establishing more climate-resilient mixed forest stands. To maintain and restore both the productive and non-productive functions of forests, adaptation measures focus on adjusting the tree species composition by replacing highly vulnerable Norway spruce trees with other autochthonous tree species that are better adapted to the changes in local climatic site conditions. Consulting services under the regional forest authority and a financial support programme have been established to encourage and promote adaptive forest management by forest owners. An intended co-benefit of re-establishing healthy and stable forests that are well adapted to current and future climatic conditions is maintenance and improvement of the delivery of their ecosystem services, in particular those related to the water retention and storage capacities of forest ecosystems. Forest cover on hillsides and mountain slopes has strong effects on reduction of surface water run-off, thus contributing significantly to groundwater renewal and to decreasing the build-up of floods. The adaptation measures taken in forest management are thus synergistic to the adaptation goals pursued by the water management sector.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The establishment of the “regional water association network” can be classified as a water governance measure that builds on inter-municipal cooperation. The crucial cooperation actors here are the municipalities, and their municipal water managers, respectively. The provincial government of Carinthia took a facilitating role by setting the policy framework for regional water governance, providing financial support and installing a hydrological monitoring network. Before founding the “regional water association network Lavant valley”, the government organised an information event for the local population. Further public participation processes did not take place, but continuous information activities of the municipalities contributed to raising awareness for water issues and building public acceptance for the measures.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Activities of the provincial government of Carinthia in terms of providing strategic state-wide policies for water supply were a success factor, because they provided an agenda and trend-setting framework. Since 1984, governmental agencies in Carinthia have been working on a state-wide water-supply strategy, presenting data on water availability and water demand at regional scale. Based on this information, suggestions for a sustainable water supply were prepared for municipalities. One of the priority objectives was to connect the water supply networks of the municipalities. Furthermore, a monitoring network with 200 hydrographic stations has been set up in the entire province to detect the actual trends in hydrological parameters like groundwater stocks or run-off patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The foundation of the “regional water association network Lavant valley” initially evolved from the initiative of one person, who was aware of the local situation regarding water supply. The person was a renowned water expert with good connections to relevant decision makers at governmental and political level. This strong personal commitment was a crucial success factor that pushed the project forward and enabled the region to face these challenges at an early stage. In a first stage, foundation of the network was controversial and opposed by a part of the local population for economic reasons. But water shortages in recent years underlined the importance of the project and helped increase its acceptance. Long term awareness-raising activities of the municipalities on water issues and water-saving measures have contributed significantly to the success in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A main goal of the adaptation measures taken has been to create strategic water reserve capacities for times of pronounced water scarcity. While this involved developing new water resources, measures are in place to avoid unsustainable over-exploitation, such as temporary demand-driven use of additional water sources only as well as permanent monitoring of the water balance situation. At the core of the regional water association network is the rationale to manage local water supply problems through regional distribution rather than through increasing the overall quantity of water extraction. Through sharing common water resources, uncoordinated and individual local reactions, like exploiting every small spring within a municipality, shall be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite all the activities done by the water association network, extremely hot and dry summers in the past (e.g. 2003) showed clearly that there is only a limited amount of water available, which does not continuously cover the needs of the municipalities. The network (together with the municipalities) is now seeking new alternatives to improve the security of the water supply in the region. One option currently being considered is the interregional extension of the water association network. Connecting the water supply network of more regions with different climatic and geological characteristics could lead to greater security of supply during risk periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation measures described in this case study are only effective for households that are hooked up to the public water supply system. However, varying percentages of households in unfavorable locations in the municipality areas depend on individual water supply by private wells. Due to highly dispersed settlement patterns in peripheral areas and high costs for the public sector, connecting these households to the public water network is not feasible. Vulnerability of this population group to water shortages continues to be high and is expected to increase in the future.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation measures taken on regional level have so far been successful in safeguarding water supply to approximately 42,000 consumers connected to the public water supply system. The measures taken by the municipal bodies responsible for local water management in the district capital of Wolfsberg have secured water supply for more than 7,000 households over the long term. Continuous access to drinking water under conditions of climate change is an indispensable prerequisite for maintaining regional population levels, social well-being and sustainable regional development potentials.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Infrastructure and economic incentives to reduce vulnerability to drought in Segura and Tagus basins]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Segura River Basin in the south east of Spain suffers from a structural condition of water scarcity and drought occurrence. For decades, the focus for dealing with this condition has been placed on instrumental objectives such as increasing water transfer facilities (i.e. Tagus Segura Water Transfer, a major diversion project), developing alternative sources (i.e. desalination and reuse) or making use of water in a more technically efficient way (i.e. irrigation modernization). So far, mainly the highly disputed water resources transferred from the Tagus basin have satisfied water demand. The changing climate is increasing drought frequency in both basins; requiring the implementation of additional strategies to adapt. A recent strategy, currently under implementation, is introducing a set of Economic Policy Instruments aimed at addressing structural modifications of the long-term water demand in the Segura basin to achieve efficient use of the limited water resources available.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Mediterranean]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tagus is the largest river basin in the Iberian Peninsula. Its Spanish section covers an area of 55,781 km2 and hosts a population of 7.2 million inhabitants highly concentrated in Greater Madrid (TRBA, 2013). Average consumptive water use amounts to 2,893 million m3/year (ibid.) with an average natural renewable resource availability of 10,214 million m3/y (1940/41 – 2005/06). Despite significant local scarcity challenges (mainly in the Upper Tagus) and high variability in water resources, severe scarcity is not pervasive and drought vulnerability is still relatively moderate in the watershed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">By contrast, the Segura river basin with a smaller area (19,025 km2) and lower population (1.98 million inhabitants in 2010, increasing in peak seasons up to 2.1 million, depending on tourist inflows) is experiencing a growing demand for water. In 2010, water demand hit 1,760 million m3 per annum (SRBA, 2013), while average renewable rainfall and runoff over the last 40 years is estimated to be only 848 million m3/year (704 million m3/year when considering the period 1980-2006) (ibid.). Water demand composition is mainly driven by the agricultural sector, accounting for around 85 per cent; the remaining part is mainly determined by domestic consumption (10 per cent of the total). Industrial demand for water in the Segura basin is almost negligible (Calatrava and Martínez-Granados, 2012).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Vulnerability to water scarcity and drought has increased due to the joint effect of three driving factors: a large inter and intra-annual variability in the precipitation patterns with implications for water-dependent economic and social development; powerful incentives in the economy leading to increased water use in the short term; and the relative failure to implement public policy responses to water scarcity, with the implications that the overall objectives of water policy have not been met.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Water scarcity in the resource scarce Segura basin is partially compensated by transferring water from relatively more abundant watersheds such as the Tagus basin via water transfer infrastructure that has been in operation since 1978. These water transfers have only been operated to provide a fraction of the planned capacity of 600 million m3 per year. The remaining deficit is mostly covered through the overexploitation of groundwater sources (a buffer stock), sometimes via illegal abstraction, re-used water, and alternative resources from desalination. It has been estimated that, even considering the water transferred from the Tagus basin, the water demand in the Segura basin exceeds the availability of renewable water resources by around 370 million m3/year. This deficit is mainly covered through non-renewable deep groundwater withdrawals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Several extremely intense drought periods have affected both basins in the past two decades. The persistent water scarcity conditions of the recent past are projected to increase in severity if the climate change driven negative trends of rainfall and runoff continue in the future. Both the fourth and fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change classified the southern part of Spain among the portions of Europe most likely to be severely impacted by a radical change in precipitation. In addition, the extreme variability of natural supply along with lower ability of water infrastructures and aquifers to store water and stabilize water supply, have severely reduced the robustness and resiliency of the entire water supply system and increased both the likelihood and the severity of droughts (Gómez and Pérez, 2012). By contrast, the economic value generated by the water-dependent agriculture has increased, consistently increasing the demand for the scarce water resources.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Current trends in water use can only be tackled and reversed by putting in place an appropriate set of incentives. Economic incentives will need to be central elements of any water policy alternative that focuses more on the so-called soft options of water management rather than just on hard (physical capital) solutions. Once the potential for additional infrastructural measures has been fully explored, as in the Segura case, available alternatives to match water supply and demand, to reduce water scarcity, to enhance drought resilience and to improve water security must be found. These could be comprised of a combination of new alternatives such as water demand management, an increase in the technical efficiency with which water is applied to any economic use, and/or the development of non-conventional sources such as regenerated or desalinated water.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In combination with the infrastructural measures already in place, the current strategy consists of the design and implementation of a set of incentives (economic policy instruments), as part of an overall policy mix. The strategy also includes supply approaches, in such a way that decisions adopted by individual water users are compatible with the overall objectives of water policy, which in this case is intended to reverse current water scarcity trends, and reduce drought risk so that water security and resilience are enhanced while improving the long-term sustainability of water management. The aims of these incentives are to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events, and to cope with drought risk and water scarcity in face of projected climate change that suggests worsening of the current situation.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Several responses to increasing water scarcity and drought risk have been implemented in the past. The focus has been placed on instrumental objectives such as increasing water conveyance facilities, developing new sources or making use of water in a more technically efficient fashion, i.e.:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The Tagus-Segura Water Transfer: The TSWT was not conceived as a climate change adaptation measure but rather to promote regional development, and has been one of the driving factors pushing irrigation development. The policy debate around the transfer has increasingly focused on whether it has spread water scarcity elsewhere rather than allowing Segura to cope with its water supply deficits.</li>
<li>Improved irrigation technology: The Segura basin is characterised by very efficient irrigation technologies. However, improved water efficiency has lowered the relative cost of using water, which in turn is an incentive to use more water. This increased water use potentially outweighs any savings from increased efficiency, reducing physical return flows, and increasing energy consumption.</li>
<li>Diversification of sources; such as groundwater, desalinated water and recycled wastewater. Desalination facilities are being used at less than one fifth of their installed capacity.</li>
<li>Drought Management Plan: In the case of drought events, these plans set up more stringent constraints to the access of publicly provided water. However, neither the Plan nor water authorities have actually introduced any ad-hoc instrument to tackle outlawed groundwater abstraction.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The economic policy instruments hereby proposed are a means to deliver the actual water policy objective which in this case consist of reversing current water scarcity trends and reducing drought risk, so that long-term sustainability of water management is improved. These ambitious objectives can only be achieved provided other intermediate and more instrumental objectives are also met. To contribute to sustainable water management, economic policy instruments must also be consistent with (and not be in contradiction with) the purposes of cost recovery such that financial sustainability in the provision of water services is guaranteed and all water users receive adequate signal of the environmental costs associated with water use and of the benefits foregone for not using water. The following are examples of opportunities to make the objectives of water policy compatible with the maintenance and enhancement in market-driven welfare:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Increase in the efficiency with which water is used so that production can be increased or maintained with lower pressures on water sources.<br />Reallocation of water from less to more productive uses, especially within the agricultural sector, so that the overall value of goods and services produced can be preserved or increased while reducing water abstractions.</li>
<li>Use of alternative resources to replace freshwater to increase adaptive capabilities in dry periods and, especially for domestic consumption, water security overall.</li>
<li>Introduction of formal insurance systems provided by the financial sector that will reduce exposure of farmers’ incomes to water uncertainty.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are the three basic instruments that have been considered:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>Water security pricing scheme; In addition to its contribution to cost recovery, the proposed reform is meant to make pricing a real mechanism to match water supply and demand, including by assigning each water source a price depending on its role in terms of the supplied quantity and its relative water security in the short and the longer term. The price of water security is introduced as a financial mechanism to guarantee the existence of buffer stocks and to allow for the recovery of depleted aquifers, as well as to reduce water demand relative to the current baseline.</li>
<li>Drought insurance; An insurance mechanism provided by financial markets (covering irrigated ligneous crops) may favour the transfer of the burden of drought risk from the natural to the financial sector. The main hypothesis is that stabilizing farmers’ income is a way to reduce incentives to withdraw more water from ground sources that are already being used unsustainably.</li>
<li>Water use rights trading scheme: A combination of intra-basin markets to improve water allocation efficiency at local levels and to enhance water usage technical efficiency, combined with an inter-basin water market scheme to transfer water from relatively more scarce to the less scarce areas.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align: justify;">The three Economic Policy Instruments, after a long period of preliminary assessment, are currently in the implementation phase. Water pricing schemes have been partially implemented; water trading schemes have been adopted to cope with water scarcity in case of drought events resulting in emergency situations; and the drought insurance schemes are currently under discussion at the national political level.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">For the specific discussion on the introduction of economic policy instruments for water demand management, facilitated stakeholder consultations were carried out through a series of meetings with selected stakeholder groups and complemented with telephone and web conferences. More than a 100 stakeholders were actively engaged in the process aimed at designing the economic policy instruments. The main actors involved were: national authorities, river basin authorities, members of the academia, irrigators, consumers associations, insurance companies, NGOs, and international experts. Meetings were held in Madrid in April 2012, November 2012, April 2013, and June 2013, and were focused on the assessment of the three economic policy instruments considered.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding traditional strategies, such as increasing water transport facilities, developing new sources or more technically efficient use of water, when judged separately and against these technical objectives those alternatives have been successful. Current infrastructure allows for the reallocation of significant amounts of water; alternative or non-conventional sources do already exist and might provide significant and reliable water services; and water use, particularly in those areas where water is scarcer, is close to the standards of best available technologies. In the same sense drought management plans have been successful in setting contingent water constraints on resources controlled by the water authority and seem to be progressing preceding from reactive, discretionary and emergency responses towards a new anticipated, contingent, and planned response to water risks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, continuous adjustment of the supply side does not favour a reduction of the demand for water. It was assumed that the social and economic cost of leaving most water demands unattended would be too high; besides neither any national management plans nor alternative water resources were available at that time. In order to expand supply, controlled and temporal over-exploitation of aquifers was approved. The environmental outcome was clear: withdrawals during 1989-1993 amounted to 148 million m3/year; these became more than 314 million m3/year during 1993-1995, which means an increase of 112% in over-exploitation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Although such policies have made new irrigation developments possible and these have helped invigorate the local economy whilst stabilizing population in rural areas, they have also caused severe environmental problems, such as aquifer depletion and the destruction of riverine ecosystems (e.g., the formerly perennial Segura River does not reach now the Mediterranean Sea during most of the year). Attending to Segura River Basin Authority (SRBA, 2013), 14 groundwater bodies have been officially declared as overexploited in the Segura; while 10 additional groundwater bodies are in the process of obtaining an official declaration of aquifer overexploitation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The proposed set of economic policy instruments have the potential to be extremely efficient in controlling and containing increasing demand, but the solutions proposed to face water policy challenges in the Segura and the Tagus involve significant transaction and transformation costs. However, in comparison to traditional infrastructure-driven alternatives, the choices proposed are not intensive in transformation cost (of fixed capital, operation and maintenance) but rather transaction costs (including information, bargaining, monitoring, enforcement, etc.) (Williamson, 2000; North, 1990, 1994; and Ostrom, 1990).</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructural interventions implemented over the past decades have driven the economic development of this area of Spain, characterized mainly by an agricultural economy. Unfortunately, rather than solving a water scarcity problem, the set of infrastructure has become a driver for enhancing the adoption of unsustainable (for this semi-arid region) agricultural practices and for massive urban development along the coastal areas. A further increase of water supply from external sources, mainly through the construction of new desalination plants, has represented a large economic investment, and yet less than one fifth of their installed capacity is actually used due to its high per unit cost (4 to 5 times higher than groundwater). Demand management, through economic policy instruments in the form of water pricing or water trading schemes, is one of the most cost-effective solutions for a more efficient allocation of the water resources among the users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Although the average bulk water price for agriculture in the Segura basin is the highest in Spain (0.096 €/m3 for conventional water sources, almost twice as large as the Spanish average of 0.05 €/m3) (SRBA, 2013d; Maestu and Villar, 2007), this price only reflects the higher financial cost of supplying water in that basin district as compared to other basins in Spain. The price is determined, in part, by the cost of the infrastructures that have been constructed over time to minimize water scarcity in the area. However, this price does not take into account either the scarcity value of the resource or the environmental costs of water supply, which, if taken into consideration, would significantly increase water price. Moreover, the observed water price is not even high enough to guarantee full-cost recovery, with cost recovery ratios ranging between 54.08% for intra-basin surface water resources and 80.82% for the Tagus Segura Water Transfer (Maestu and Villar, op. cit.). This situation is even more striking when considering that most of these investments were ultimately aimed at guaranteeing water security in agriculture, a private endeavour. This alone could justify a price increase on the grounds of cost-recovery, as required by the EC Water Framework Directive. On the other hand, of additional concern is that such a policy may result in adverse effects on the local economy, which heavily relies on agriculture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Water pricing re-design is meant to address a critical issue: how much would current water prices need to increase to guarantee water provision in dry periods. The suggested water pricing security scheme works as a cost-sharing mechanism among those interested in having a secure water supply.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The analysis on drought insurance shows that between the fair risk premium and risk-averse farmers’ willingness to pay, there is space for insurance systems that would stabilize income and reduce incentives for groundwater overexploitation during dry periods. Charging households for the capital costs of desalination plants would result in a negligible effect on household water demand (estimated in less than 0.7%). Urban water security through desalination increases water availability and security for agriculture, which results in reduced income variability, stable employment and positive forward linkages in other economic sectors (i.e. agro-industry). This provides the rationale for sharing costs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Water use right trading has been designed on the basis of an analysis of actual opportunities for water transfers among different users. This analysis included identification of operational costs implied in those trades and the analysis of third-party effects. Even ignoring other transaction costs, this analysis shows that opportunities for water trading decay with distance as transport costs increase. Neither transport costs nor third-party effects are very significant when water is traded on a local basis among users of the same kind (i.e. irrigators within the same irrigation district).</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Water Framework Directive explicitly states that water pricing has to be used as an incentive to adapt water demand to the EU environmental standards, especially in overexploited areas such as the SRB (EC, 2000). Higher prices for conventional water sources in agriculture may improve the status of water bodies in the SRB in two ways. On the one hand, they can reduce the expected income and thus limit water demand from low productive crops; on the other, they favour the replacement of overexploited conventional water sources by largely idle non-conventional ones.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The EU Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Waters regards water pricing as “a powerful awareness/raising tool for consumers and combines environmental with economic benefits, while stimulating innovation” (COM, 2012). By including environmental and resource costs in water service tariffs, the EU Water Framework Directive requirement of cost/recovery points towards establishing a pricing system that deals better with environmental externalities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The legal framework that regulates the agricultural insurance system in Spain is laid out in the 87/1978 Law of December 28, on combined agricultural insurances, and the 2329/1979 Government Decree of September 14, which approves the Regulation for the application of the Law. The EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change, published in April 2013, aims at encouraging the development and implementation of adaptation action by the MS, with special focus on win-win, low-cost and no-regret options. As one of the actions to be promoted under its adaptation strategy, the Commission included the expansion of insurance and other financial products in the context of natural and man-made disasters (COM, 2013).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The reform of the Spanish Water Law in 1999 (Law 46/1999, BOE 14-12-1999) introduced the so-called lease contracts (contratos de cesión) and water banks (centros de intercambio) that paved the way for certain transfers of water rights for a given period of time including a pecuniary compensation. The transfer contract for exclusive water use rights on public-domain waters is regulated under articles 67 and ulterior ones of the Water Law, approved by Government Decree 1/2001, of July 20th, 2001 (Vázquez, 2010).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Integrating climate change adaptation into coastal planning in Šibenik-Knin County (Croatia)]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Šibenik-Knin County in Croatia has 960 km of coast and 285 islands and rocks. Its coastal zone consists of seven municipalities and three cities including Šibenik, the administrative centre. The Coastal Plan for the Šibenik-Knin County focuses on the impacts of climate change in the coastal zone and adaptation to projected changes. The Coastal Plan (at December 2014) is being prepared by the PAP/RAC (Priority Actions Programme/ Regional Activity Centre) in Split and the Plan Bleu: both are components of the UNEP Mediterranean Action Programme. The work uses the DIVA (Dynamic Integrated Vulnerability Assessment) method and the participatory Climagine method, among others, to assess the climate variability and change in the coastal zone. The preparation of the Coastal Plan commenced in January 2013 and is to be finalised in 2015. The Plan will not be binding, but will inform national and regional processes and stakeholder actions.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Šibenik-Knin County has a population of about 110,000 inhabitants, with 2994 square km of land area and 2676 square km of sea. The county’s coastal zone is urbanised (over 70% of the County’s population resides in coastal settlements) and is characterised by a concentration of economic activities (tourism, metal industry, shipyards, sea transport and vineyards). In 2008, UNDP’s Human Development Report for Croatia (entitled A Climate for Change), noted that the county had coastal areas that were highly vulnerable to climate change (for example, the island of Krapanj, with over 200 inhabitants, has an average altitude of only 2 m above the sea level). Background work for the Coastal Plan identified the main climate-related challenges for the area of Šibenik-Knin County:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Coastal protection: (i) flooding of historical towns (e.g. Šibenik), (ii) negative impact on the Krka river basin, Krka river estuary, Šibenik bay and islands (e.g. islands of Krapanj and Žirje), (iii) limited erosion of the coastline, especially exposed parts not made out of rocks.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Water services: (i) reduced precipitation during summer and autumn months and increased precipitation during winter months, (ii) groundwater scarcity, (iii) reduction of available freshwater sources in the coastal zone, (iv) reduced availability of water for tourism, agriculture and other economic activities (e.g. energy production).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Agriculture and fisheries: (i) reduced soil moisture during summer due to increased evapotranspiration and decrease of precipitation, (ii) possible change in the plants cultivated, (iii) change to plants life cycle, (iv) reduction of possibility of cultivation of certain marine species due to higher temperatures and pollution (e.g. shellfish), (v) algal blooms due to the temperature increases.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Conservation: (i) increase presence of invasive species, (ii) negative impact on nutrient balance, reduction of oxygen levels, increase of biological activity, ultimately changing biotopes and biocoenosis in the surface waters, (iii) increased frequency and intensity of forest fires which will impact ecosystems and which will impact erosion and creation of barren lands further impacting water ecosystems.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Tourism: (i) risk of decrease in the number of tourists during hot periods, (ii) water scarcity during the touristic season in larger settlements (e.g. Šibenik, Vodice, Murter, Primošten, Rogoznica) and islands (e.g. Žirje and Kaprije), (iii) change in the landscape influenced by water scarcity and fires, impacting tourism.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Other: (i) impact on the insurance industry (increased costs due to fires, increased premiums), (ii) impact on the banking industries (risks for mortgages taken on the property located in the coastal zone), (iii) increase of energy demand during hot periods, (iv) reduction of energy production (four hydropower plants are located in the Krka river basin), (v) possible impact on marine transport and ship building.</li>
</ul>]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objectives of the Coastal Plan for Šibenik-Knin County are to:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Promote accepting sustainability and resilience as coastal zone development criteria;</li>
<li>Create prerequisites for defining sustainability in concrete domains (population, coast, space, water, sea, nature, production);</li>
<li>Contribute to the strengthening of participation and education;</li>
<li>Provide guidelines for sectoral policies and plans to achieve sustainability and resilience;</li>
<li>Make recommendations for resolving conflicting issues in achieving sustainability and resilience;</li>
<li>Offer a platform for sustainable development of the Šibenik-Knin County coastal zone based on water as its fundamental resource, blue economy and smart specialization.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The Coastal Plan may have an influence concerning allocation of EU funds linked to coastal development. In addition to other things, the Coastal Plan contributes to protection, restoration and preservation of the coastal zone's resources.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the Coastal Plan for Šibenik-Knin County as well as related activities, such as work in Croatia using the DIVA model, are part of a larger UNEP/GEF project entitled ”Integration of Climatic Variability and Change into National Strategies to Implement the Protocol on ICZM in the Mediterranean”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DIVA method provides forecasts of climate impacts and costs that are used in preparing the Coastal Plan. The DIVA method builds modular integrated computer models by bringing together knowledge from natural and social disciplines. DIVA enables users to choose scenarios and adaptation strategies and to compare results for different scenarios and adaptation strategies. It is being used to assess the possible costs of climate variability and change for all of Croatia’s coast. Due to the small size of Šibenik-Knin County, DIVA results for Croatian coastal zone will be downscaled for Šibenik-Knin County for the purpose of the Coastal Plan. This task will be carried out by a group of international experts taking into consideration local data concerning tourism, agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure and possible forest fire costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate impacts and possible adaptation responses were discussed with stakeholders in the county using a participatory method called Climagine, which was developed as part of the larger UNEP/GEF project. Climagine is designed for sustainable coastal zone management needs in Mediterranean areas, with a special focus on climate variability and change. Local stakeholders are asked to define the sustainable development of the coastal zone and to come up with methods of how it should be attained. The work stimulates communication among local stakeholders on coastal and climate variability and change issues and facilitates participation in the development of the Coastal Plan. It engages stakeholders via a 4-step participatory process intended to describe, assess and examine the past, present and future levels of sustainability of a local socio-economic system, setting goals and monitoring the system’s progress towards sustainable development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through its integrated approach, the Coastal Plan will recommend possible solutions concerning the following dimensions and issues:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Water; adaptation to climate variability and change in: (i) water resources management (measures for rational use of fresh water resources, providing water for irrigation, water demand management, reduction of water losses); (ii) river management (regulation of low and high flows of rivers, flood protection measures, retaining, storing, drainage, giving more space to river). Solutions will also be proposed for problems caused by storm waters through an integrated approach for urban drainage.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure: adaptation measures for protection against coastal flooding, measures for adaptation of the existing coastal infrastructure to the expected higher sea levels, and planning of future infrastructure so as to avoid negative impacts of climate change, including giving more space to sea.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Forest fires: improvement of prevention through spatial planning, agriculture, cattle breeding, awareness raising and early warning system.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Regional development; (i) Regional development within Šibenik – Knin County: balanced urban and rural development to reduce pressure on the coastal zone. (ii) Development of the entire Šibenik – Knin County region: adaptation to climate variability and change in tourism (strategic enhancement of the tourist offer aiming for the extension of the tourist season, compensating for climate variability). (iii) Other issues affecting both the regional development within Šibenik – Knin County and of the entire County: mariculture, agriculture, port management, recommendations for green and blue growth.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Spatial planning: implementation of Article 8 of the ICZM Protocol for the Mediterranean; managed realignment to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts; protection of the landscape; marine spatial planning for more sustainable sea use.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Governance and management: ICZM coordination body at the regional level, creating favourable conditions for participation, awareness raising and capacity building.</li>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Climagine” method engages stakeholders within a four-step participatory process intended to describe, assess and examine the past, present and future levels of sustainability of a local socio-economic system, setting goals and monitoring the system’s progress towards sustainable development. For the preparation of the Šibenik-Knin Coastal Plan, the “Climagine” method was implemented through four workshops:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>1st “Climagine” workshop, 8 April 2013 - The workshop was attended by 60 participants from all sectors apart from the business sector.  The main objectives of the first workshop were to: achieve a common understanding among stakeholders of the context; draw up a territorial diagnosis of the covered coastal zone; identify priority issues in the coastal zone; and prioritise issues.</li>
<li>2nd “Climagine” workshop, 8 November 2013 - The workshop was attended by 50 participants from all sectors.  The main objectives of the second workshop were to:  select a final core set of indicators relating to the issues defined during the first workshop; define band of equilibrium of the selected indicators; use a matrix to rank the issues and indicators; and check what data is available to populate the indicators. </li>
<li>3rd “Climagine” workshop, 9 June 2014 - The workshop was attended by 40 participants.  Representatives of NGOs and businesses from Šibenik-Knin county did not take part in the workshop.  The main objectives of the third workshop were to: define the assumptions of scenarios; explore scenarios; present and discuss the results; and issue recommendations and determine priorities for the Coastal Plan.</li>
<li>4th “Climagine” workshop, January/February 2015 - The workshop will take place after the finalisation of drafting of this document.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the workshops, a set of interviews was conducted with key stakeholders. The aim of the interviews was to acquire local knowledge, elicit local creative ideas and create a relationship of trust on which the future implementation of the Coastal Plan relies.  The following interviews were carried out:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Governance and policy-making bodies – thirteen interviews;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Regional and local authorities – eight interviews;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">State institutions represented in Šibenik-Knin County – three interviews;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Education and research institutions – two interviews;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Civil society (NGOs) – two interviews;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Businesses – three interviews.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Stakeholder participation – The “Climagine” workshops and interviews succeeded in involving a large number of stakeholders from different sectors (governance and policy making; civil society; and business) in the preparation of the Coastal Plan.</li>
<li>Establishing a link between relevant sectorial plans, spatial plans, the Development Strategy of Šibenik-Knin County, and the Coastal Plan –The Coastal Plan aims to assist in overcoming the current shortcomings spatial planning, in particular the absence of the consideration of climate change in the current plans. The Coastal Plan is not competing with spatial or development planning, but it adds a value by enhancing long term prospective and indicating “entry points” and solutions for integration.  The Coastal Plan also establishes links with other relevant plans and strategies, such as the Development Strategy of Šibenik Knin County, which is to be reviewed in 2015.</li>
<li>Collection and storage of data – The Coastal Plan – and the DIVA work – will also result in collection and storage of relevant information, knowledge and awareness on the climate variability and change, and on the possible impacts on the coastal zone.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Main limiting factors include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Ambiguity concerning the legal basis for preparation of the Coastal Plan therefore impacting the Plan’s effect - The relevant planning legislation in Croatia does not foresee the preparation of an Coastal Plan at county level. The lack of legal certainty concerning the status of the Coastal Plan for Šibenik-Knin County and its relationship with other planning documents could impact its effectiveness.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The existing spatial and physical plans do not give special attention to the coastal zone - The Šibenik-Knin County has a full set of spatial plans, as required under the Croatian legislation.  The county spatial plan, as well as municipal and city plans, do not give special attention to the coastal zone and its management.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The issue of climate change is still very new for the stakeholders and inhabitants of Šibenik-Knin County and of Croatia. As a result, they may not fully grasp the importance of the issue resulting in failure to take timely measures to adapt to of climate change and minimize their negative impacts.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Difficulties in obtaining relevant information. There were difficulties in accessing information on the past events, especially on the damages while preparing the Coastal Plan.  Representatives of banking and insurance sectors did not become involved in the preparation of the Coastal Plan.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Overall climate change costs and benefits for Šibenik-Knin County</em><br />Costs and benefits related to climate change will be calculated on the basis of DIVA method for the Croatian coastal zone as a whole.  The downscaling of the results for Šibenik-Knin County, for the purpose of the Coastal Plan, is being carried out by a group of international experts. The assessment of costs and benefits will concern priority sectors and issues identified via the Climagine workshops and interviews. These include: tourism, agriculture, mariculture, infrastructure and forest fires. Downscaled DIVA results for impacts of coastal flooding and erosion on population and assets, along with results of other analysis of the vulnerability of the Šibenik-Knin County coastal zone, will be used in the overall assessment of possible costs and benefits of climate variability and change on the local economy.  The findings will aim to show the relative significance of estimated costs and benefits for the priority sectors and issues, and to inform and provide recommendations for adaptation priorities in the Coastal Plan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><em>Overall Projects costs and benefits</em><br />Information on the overall costs and benefits of the Coastal Plan itself was not available. The preparation of the Plan is supported by a UNEP/MAP GEF project, ”Integration of Climatic Variability and Change into National Strategies to Implement the Protocol on ICZM in the Mediterranean”. Its objectives include: awareness raising concerning climate variability and change; and promoting ICZM as an effective tool to address climate variability and change impacts. Concerning project benefits, it is expected that implementation of recommendations and measures of the Coastal Plan will decrease possible damage caused by the climate variability and change, assist in the process of internalizing environmental costs for more sustainable development and encourage the development of more resilient economy of the coastal zone of the Šibenik-Knin County.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Coastal Plan will not be binding. Croatian national legislation does not foresee preparation of the coastal plans at county level. However, Article 18(3) of the ICZM Mediterranean Protocol, of which Croatia is a Party, provides for preparation of the Coastal Plan at “an appropriate territorial level”. According to the Croatian Constitution, the ratified international agreements, such as the ICZM Protocol, have a primacy over domestic law. However, there are no provisions in the Croatian legislation specifying a procedure for the adoption of a county ICM plan or its relationship to other planning documents. The Coastal Plan is nonetheless largely in line with Croatian legislation on the spatial and physical planning of the Šibenik-Knin County.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the county’s Coastal Plan is linked to the preparation of a national Strategy for Management of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Zone. This Strategy will fulfil Croatia’s obligation to develop a coastal strategy under the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol, which Croatia ratified in 2012, and a marine strategy under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC).</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The preparation of the Coastal Plan started in January 2013 and is expected to be finalised during 2015. Once draft of the Coastal Plan is available, it will be discussed by relevant stakeholders to elaborate the Final Coastal Plan.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[European funds for flood protection measures in Smolyan - Bulgaria]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In response to flooding causing damage in Smolyan’s Ustovo neighbourhood in 2005, the city implemented a number of flood protection measures that presumably have paid off already during the wet year of 2014. Under the project, river banks were widened, existing protection walls were reinforced and new walls constructed. The cost of about 480,000 EUR was mainly derived from funding by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The constructions aimed at minimizing the chance on future floods thereby avoiding damage and possible negative impacts on human health and the environment. Following on the successful implementation of the ERDF project, the current 7-year Municipal Development Plan of Smolyan (developed in 2014) has incorporated more flood protection measures for other neighbourhoods in the city. These will be implemented stepwise in the programme period. </span></p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In 2005, the Ustovo neighbourhood in the city of Smolyan experienced serious problems due to flooding of the Cherna River after extreme rainfall. In the beginning of August 2005, the Ihtiman cyclone formed over the western Mediterranean and moved eastwards to enter the west of Bulgaria on August 4. The night from 5 to 6 August is marked by the severity of the weather in the Rhodopes mountains, close to Smolyan. The region of Smolyan is among those reporting the highest 24-hour cumulative amount of precipitation (156 mm, 218 litres per square meter) at 7h30 local time on August 6.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The district’s infrastructure was not built to handle this amount of precipitation (which is known to happen once every 1000 years) and the Cherna river that flows through the city burst its banks and caused people’s homes to be flooded and damaged. Though it is uncertain whether climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in Smolyan, the municipality decided to be on the precautionary side and took measures to adapt the district’s infrastructure to future floods.</span></p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The flood protection measures have been implemented to reduce the risk of flooding in the Ustovo District (specifically residential areas “Progresi” 1, 2 and 3) in the city of Smolyan with the aim to protect the population and to prevent flood damage.</span></p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project consisted of two main construction works: (1) expansion and cleaning of the riverbed of the Cherna River to have a higher capacity for dealing with high amounts of water, and (2) reconstruction and upgrading of the existing retaining walls and construction of new walls with reinforced concrete railings and parapets on the left and right bank of the river. These works are carried out through nine sub-projects. In total 240 metres of new flood walls were built, and over 430 metres of existing walls were reinforced. The new Municipal Development Plan envisages construction of additional facilities to prevent flooding, including: cleaning the riverbeds of vegetation and sediments, reconstruction of the two municipal dams (Kiranov dol and Laga), and afforestation of adjacent land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to be informed and warned in time, the municipality regularly receives information on rainfall by the Ministry of Environment and Water. Also, there is a website (<a href="http://arda.hydro.bg">http://arda.hydro.bg</a>) which provides hourly information (even per minute) on expected rainfall and river water levels. Municipal experts process this information and post it on the municipal website.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Mayor and the municipal experts held many meetings during the project where they thoroughly explained to residents the need for the flood protection measures and their positive effect. Few people were directly affected by the construction works. There were some issues with the residents as, for instance, illegal buildings on the construction site, like barns and gardens that had to be demolished before work could start.  However, they could be solved within the legislative framework and did not result in protests or any major negative reactions.</span></p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Funding by the EU was an important factor in enabling the construction works. The municipality applied for funding with the Operational Programme ‘Regional Development’ (see also ‘Costs and Benefits’ section), for which granting can be hard sometimes.  Municipal experts took care of the application form and they had access to all the information required for the project, including preliminary studies and technical designs, as well as a clearly defined goal. This helped them greatly in the process of applying for EU funding.  The project proposal was submitted to the ministry of regional development in 2012. The ministry acted at the time as a managing authority of this programme and when the project was granted, a contract was drafted between the ministry and the municipality of Smolyan. In the next phase, an open procedure was started for the construction work. The construction company answered directly to the municipality, who in turn reported to the ministry.<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Other factors that contributed to the smooth implementation of the project were the fact that the land on which the measures are being implemented is owned by the municipality and that it was easy to obtain building permits.</span></p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The costs of the flood protection measures combined surmounted to 933.438 Bulgarian Lev, or €477.259 Euro. A small part, 5% of the total sum (46.959 Lev, or €24.010), was provided from the municipal budget of Smolyan. The majority of funding 886.478 Lev (€453.249) originated from the EU through the Operational Programme “Regional Development 2007 – 2013 (Contract No BG161PO001/1.4-06/2010/011), ‘Support For Small-Scale Measures To Prevent Flooding In Urban Agglomerations’).  This programme was approved by the European Commission in 2007 and applied to the whole territory of Bulgaria for the period 2007-2013. The main objectives of the Operational Programme were to:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><span>reduce the socio-economic differences between Bulgaria and other EU Member States;</span></li>
<li><span>make living and working conditions in Bulgaria more attractive;</span></li>
<li><span>develop tourism potential; and</span></li>
<li><span>stimulate investments in smaller municipalities.</span></li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Operational Programme fell under the framework laid out for Convergence and Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objectives (co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)) and had a total budget of around €1.6 billion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The benefits of the measures (in terms of reduced damage due to flooding) have not been estimated and quantified. One could say, however, that the damage of the 2005 flood event will now be avoided during future heavy precipitation events. In fact, a reoccurrence with significant damage could have occurred in 2014. The year 2014 was a very wet year and other neighbourhoods in Smolyan have experienced flooding, but the Ustovo district was not affected. Other co-benefits have not been taken into account.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The new measures of the current Municipal Development Plan will be funded by different sources such as by the municipal budget, the Operational Programme ‘Environment’ (2014 – 2020), Cross-border Cooperation Programmes, and by the Inter-ministerial Committee on Disaster.</span></p>

    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main bodies responsible for flood protection care in Smolyan are the East Belomorksi Region Basin Directorate of Plovdiv, as well as the mayor of the municipality of the water course concerned. The municipality is responsible for maintenance of the implemented measures which consists of cleaning the riverbed of vegetation and sediments twice a year.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Financial Institutions: preparing the market for adapting to climate change – Climabiz]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change will have an adverse impact on many economic sectors (such as energy, food, construction, tourism, insurance). In the banking sector, it is acknowledged that risks faced by clients also create risks for banks. Risk management activities should therefore aim at the management of risk for the benefit of the clients, the financial institutions and the business community alike. Climabiz was an innovative LIFE project aimed to quantify risks and opportunities for Greek enterprises deriving from climate change. Piraeus Bank, the coordinating beneficiary, implemented the project in close cooperation with two associated beneficiaries, WWF Greece and Facets, with the goal to trigger the adaptation of the market to the risks and financial impacts of climate change. At the same time, the project was a case study of a financial institution’s attempt to prepare the market to combat (adapt and mitigate) climate change. The project’s innovation regarding the identification of adaptive responses towards climate change rested in the creation of the Climate Risk Management Model, which calculates, in monetized terms, the climate risk for Greek businesses and provides solutions to reducing this risk.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since climate change affects the economy, it is obvious that the business world will not remain untouched. Climate change implies a series of risks for businesses, which might impact the smooth functioning of their services and activities. These risks are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Physical risks: impacts on infrastructure and buildings due to floods, fire, storms, etc.</li>
<li>Regulatory risks: pertains to all possible impacts stemming from the introduction of climate change policies, like new legal and regulatory frameworks, taxation and newly imposed operational procedures.</li>
<li>Market/reputational risks: pertains to potential consequences from changes in the market condition or from any disruption of the relation between producers and consumers.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">However, there are some opportunities from climate change such as business opportunities due to new products or change in demand for low carbon dioxide products. The degree of challenges and opportunities is primarily related to sectorial parameters as well as to geographical/spatial location. For example, agriculture and tourism are more subject to physical risks than industry, which is facing significant risks from a change in the regulatory framework. Climate change is not only a challenge for large companies but also for SMEs, which comprise the backbone of the economy in many countries. While theoretically all enterprises are subject to climate risks, a quantitative analysis inevitably needs to be restricted to considerable risks only given the very large number of individual loan recipients at a single bank’s level. Thus, the Climate Risk Management Model was focused on ‘priority sectors/ sub-sectors’, whose economic performance is to be significantly affected by climate change or where their aggregated risk turns to be significant because of their share to the total bank’s lending portfolio. Within the development of the Climate Risk Management Model, a major challenge faced during the risk analysis was the diversification of the bank’s clientele. Even within the same economic sub-sector, the number of enterprises may be large and their characteristics very diverse. To reduce this problem to a manageable size, the development of a ‘typical’ unit for appropriately identified groups of units in each sector/ sub-sector was performed. This approach has been utilised to date for the assessment of extreme weather and natural disaster related risk for industries (Geldermann et al. 2008) and the promotion of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in industry (Geldermann and Rentz 2004; Georgopoulou et al. 2007). (For further information please see: Georgopoulou et al., 2015. A methodological framework and tool for assessing the climate change related risks in the banking sector. <em>Journal of Environmental Planning and Management</em>, vol. 58, issue 5, pp. 874-897).</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objectives of the project were to:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify business impacts and opportunities that arise from climate change in Greece and South-eastern Europe in general;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop special tools (computational models) to estimate the costs of climate change impacts for businesses and the costs of their adaptation practices;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Inform, guide and support companies towards a smoother adaptation to climate change;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Raise awareness and educate shareholders, suppliers, employees and the broader public with regard to tackling climate change and adapting to the new conditions.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the solutions is the development of the Climate Risk Management Model (CRMM) which provides integrated solutions, suggesting interventions that enhance businesses’ adaptability to new climatic conditions and reduce their carbon footprint. More specifically, the Model includes a database of potential measures, used in various economic sectors worldwide, in order for a business to reduce its GHG emissions. Additionally, the Model provides some basic cost estimations for each potential intervention as well as the incurred mitigation potential in terms of GHG emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Piraeus Bank, using the CRMM, was able to estimate the climate risk of its portfolio in monetary terms. It covers any risk resulting from climate change and affecting businesses: physical risks (increase of temperature, extreme weather phenomena, crop failure etc.) and regulatory risks (emission costs, fines, increase in the price of consumed energy etc.). However, it still constitutes a first effort to quantitatively estimate climate risk in Greece. With the CRMM, Piraeus Bank examined a specific sample of businesses in branches of the economy that may be adversely affected by climate change. This estimate allows an assessment of climate risk in relation to the other financial risks and enables climate risk to be integrated in a general risk management strategy for the financial sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the framework of the Climabiz project, three e-learning programmes were completed. The first one was assigned to the Bank’s Human Resources Division and was completed by 829 employees in Greece, 113 in Cyprus, 178 in Romania and 28 in Bulgaria. The second and a third part was completed and assigned to the Bank’s employees. In total, over 1,300 unique employees completed the e-learning programmes. Moreover, 19 workshops were held for green banking advisors, small business officers and credit analysts in Greece, as well as 3 workshops for the top management of subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus with around 450 participants. Additionally, a permanent section titled “Green News”, which thousands of employees has access to, was uploaded on the intranet, with a weekly update on global news regarding climate change, the economy and the environment and also green business. The Green News also features on the intranet of the subsidiary Piraeus Bank Cyprus Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, in total 68 small business officers, located at 68 different branches all around Greece, were trained on how to use the CRMM and how to communicate the results to clients. The small business officers approached 680 clients belonging to almost all economic sectors included in the Model. Each case study was saved in the Model and sent to the environment Unit and the green banking division, which analysed the results as regards the potential investments on energy saving, the potential cost saving and the potential reduction of greenhouse gases with the hypothesis that the majority of those investments would take place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to notice that Piraeus Bank, the Climabiz project and all associated partners successfully managed for the first time in Greece to communicate in monetary terms the impacts of climate change on economic sectors in general and specific impacts to individual business. With the implementation of this task, the main target of the project being “assisting the Greek market to adapt to climate change”, was achieved. A sample of healthy businesses of the Greek market were informed on how they were going to be affected by climate change and what were the most economically beneficial technical solutions to timely and efficiently adapt to climate change. The CRMM is in the process of being fully incorporated into the standard procedures of the Bank and become part and parcel of its credit policies. In 2013, planning was continued towards the incorporation of climate risk into the credit - rating system of Bank customers. In 2014, updating and upgrading of the CRMM was designed so that it will provide more in- depth data assessment in the agriculture and tourism sectors; this will conclude in early 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the Bank is committed to measuring and continuously monitoring its environmental impacts with a view towards climate change mitigation. Environmental impacts are also defined as the Bank’s “footprint” on the environment, which is affected through the consumption of natural resources, the emission of greenhouse gasses, waste disposal etc. Indicatively, data concerning electricity, heating fuel, water and other natural resource consumption are collected annually and, by means of the Environmental Footprint Calculator Database, are applied to calculate specific indices that reflect the total environmental performance. In 2012, the Group’s environmental footprint was reduced with almost all environmental performance indices showing improvement. Since 2008, there has been an 18% per capita reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-day workshop was organized, personal interviews took place and an online questionnaire was offered to around 50 stakeholders representing the industry/private sector, small-medium enterprises, NGO’s, the public sector and the academia, to discuss how the Greek market perceives the impacts of climate change.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The principal goal of the Climabiz project was to trigger the adaptation of the market to the risks and financial impacts of climate change. This goal was achieved by developing an innovative approach to adaptation of enterprises to the financial impacts of climate change. Piraeus Bank, Facets and WWF Greece quantified risks and opportunities deriving from climate change, trained the Bank’s personnel to comprehend those issues, investigated how different businesses could adapt to such changes, disseminated this information and provided assistance to the business community by using the Bank’s extensive network of branches. An important outcome of the project was that the main target of the project, “assisting the Greek market to adapt to climate change” was achieved by assessing the climate risk and valorising the climate adaptation solutions for 680 enterprises (clients of the Bank) and disseminating this information to them.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Total cost at the end of the project was € 1.683.141,41. Direct / quantitative benefits can be summarised as follow:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Climate risk estimation for the Greek financial sector: for the first time ever climate risk was estimated, in monetary terms, for a financial institution in Greece. This estimation allows an assessment of climate risks in relation to the other financial risks, to enable climate risk to be integrated in a general risk management strategy for the financial sector. It also provides a benchmarking value for other banks both at national and international level, allowing setting targets during decision and policy making at European level.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation of Greek business to climate change: a total of 677 clients from several economic sectors responded to Piraeus Bank campaign on climate adaptation solutions. A pilot exercise on the adoption of the majority of the climate mitigation measures by hotels taking part in the pilot indicated that a risk reduction of 22% per year and a carbon reduction of 70% per year are possible in a cost-benefit manner.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increase in low carbon investments. The Climabiz project enhanced Piraeus Bank’s effort in low carbon investments. During 2012 Piraeus Bank increased its green credit limits and balances by 26% from the year prior to €1,3 billion and €861 million, respectively.</li>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Climate bond financing adaptation actions in Paris]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Sustainable development has been a major concern for the City of Paris for more than 10 years. When, in 2015, the City of Paris hosted the COP21, the City Hall wanted to send out a strong signal to the international community and to other local and regional authorities and show the diversity of municipal ecological actions and commitments. To emphasize this, the City of Paris erected the climate bond to finance climate and energy projects. The total size of the bond is € 300 million, with a running time until May 2031. The bond aims at private investors who consider it as a secondary advantage to invest in the sustainability of the city of Paris. They will receive a profit rate of 1.75% per year. 20% of the climate bond funds have been assigned to adaptation projects. Currently, two projects with a climate adaptation objective have been included in the bond and are being implemented: planting 20,000 trees in the city and creating 30 hectares of new parks by 2020.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to climate change Paris expects an increase in average daily temperatures as well as in the number of hot, very hot and extremely hot days and in the occurrence of heatwaves. The heatwave of 2003 had a devastating impact on the country, leading to almost 15,000 heat related deaths in France. Projections are that the summer of 2003 could become a normal summer in 2050 and the Paris Heatwave Plan was drawn up in response to this. Heat stress is, therefore, an important focal point for the city of Paris and measures to prevent it, like green gardens, parks and roofs and use of water for cooling, are being implemented. A trend for more frequent droughts has also been documented by Météo-France, with less summer rainfall, a decreased flow rate of the river Seine and an increased risk of agricultural drought in Île-de-France. This may impact the supply of drinking water from surface waters. The climate projections for Paris also indicate an increase of the frequency of heavy rains in the coming century. Floods, however, are not expected to be more or less frequent due to climate change. But since the consequences of a flood by the Seine overflowing its banks or by rainfall runoff after heavy rains can be in any case significant, there is a need for flood protection.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim of Paris climate bond is to finance energy-climate projects, covering the 4 main goals of the Paris Climate &#38; Energy Action Plan: reduction of GHG emissions, improvement of energy efficiency, production of renewable and/or recovered energy, and adaptation to climate change. The purpose of the Adaptation Strategy, one of the operational documents of the Paris Climate &#38; Energy Action Plan, is to prepare the city for both future climate changes as well as for future scarcity of certain resources such as water, energy, food and biodiversity. This is translated into four main objectives:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>protect Parisians from extreme climate events;</li>
<li>ensure the supply of water, food and energy;</li>
<li>live with climate change: more sustainable city planning;</li>
<li>foster new lifestyles and boost solidarity.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of both adaptation projects under implementation within the climate bond is to reduce the urban heat island effect and increase thermal comfort within the city, which mainly relates to objectives 1 and 3 of the Adaptation Strategy.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Climate bond</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A climate bond is perceived as an interesting and profitable mechanism by the city to finance public projects, because it consists of a wide variety of investor profiles (few investors are interested in bonds which are only climate-related) and requires transparency. Transparency is ensured by annual reporting, where the issuer has to justify the allocation of money to projects complying with the set criteria. The process and report is reviewed by the non-financial rating agency Vigeo, thereby providing investors reassurance on the use of their funds. In addition, the transparency is an opportunity for the city to question internal practices and improve them if needed. Also, the climate bond highlights political priorities by ranking investments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The selection of projects to be included in the bond is managed by the Finance Management Support Service (SGF) of the city in full collaboration with the Urban Ecology Agency of Paris (AEU) and overseen by Vigeo. The list of projects to choose from is defined at the start of each election term. After each election, the new Mayor presents his/her political direction to the Council of Paris for approval. This direction is financially translated in an investment programme (defining political priorities and pushes) and corresponding projects. The selection process among these projects was based on several criteria that are a combination of criteria brought forward by SGF and criteria which are usually used for Socially Responsible Investments (SRI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>1. Municipal internal criteria</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first criterion is that a project should contribute to (one of) the four goals of the Climate and Energy Action Plan. Secondly, only projects of the investment programme that have not already been initiated are financed (‘new’ projects), as they are more attractive to investors, easier for annual reporting and show the prospective approach of the City of Paris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>2. ‘Green Bond Principles’ and operational criteria</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The climate bond is a kind of green bond and is subject to the ‘Green Bond Principles’. In addition, after the pre-selection according to criteria described above, the SGF and the AEU make a further selection of projects and organize meetings with project managers, representatives of the AEU and Vigeo to refine this selection. The aims of this step in the process are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Get precise information on each project (e.g. what will be done exactly, refined budgetary allocation, planning of the project, monitoring methods) and check that each aspect (environmental, social, governance) of the project matches with the ‘use of proceeds’ defining eligible categories of projects (according to the ‘Green Bond Principles (GBP))’ and are compatible with rules of liquidity and project management.</li>
<li>Check that each selected project contains real and mainly measurable environmental benefits and that measuring procedures and instruments are or can be implemented by various departments and/or the AEU (accredited for Carbon Evaluation). For the adaptation projects the results are simply expressed in surface area of green spaces created (target: +30ha by 2020) and/or number of trees planted (target: +20,000 by 2020);</li>
<li>Build the framework reflecting indicators and climate benefits to which City of Paris is committed.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Note that a project under the climate bond should not necessarily be implemented within Paris, as long as City of Paris is a direct paying agent and the prime contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adaptation projects</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two adaptation projects are currently included in the climate bond and respectively involve planting 20,000 trees and creating 30 hectares of new parks. The time limit for finalizing the adaptation projects is 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new trees will be planted in the inner city of Paris (as opposed to the already existing two woods outside of Paris), in the streets and at public facilities such as school playgrounds, gymnasiums, etc. Since the beginning of 2016 until the summer of the same year, around 2,000 trees have already been planted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new parks will be created both in the urban renewal zones of Paris, where there is the biggest potential for large areas of parks, as well as in some already existing neighbourhoods of Paris where local places can be transformed into little local parks for the residents. The Martin Luther King Park in the Clichy Batignolles urban renewal zone (North West of Paris, 17th arrondissement) for example, first opened in 2008, was extended in 2014 and is still under works to be extended again by 2018, bringing its total area to 10 ha. Only the extensions of 2014 (2.2 ha) and 2018 (3.5 ha) will be counted into the 30 ha target of 2020. Maintenance of the parks and trees will be covered by the City itself and not by the climate bond investments, as this is not allowed.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Climate bond</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Paris climate bond was initiated by the City of Paris, created both by the Finance and Procurement Department (DFA) and the Parks and Environment Department of Paris. Due to the fact that the 2015 Paris climate bond was the first socially responsible public offering made by the City of Paris, the DFA has asked, in the context of public procurement, a non-financial rating agency (Vigeo) to assist the City at the preparatory stage of this public offering. This way, the Finance Management Support Service (SGF) could benefit from the sectoral expertise of this agency, its guidance and its methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Credit Agricole CIB, HSBC and Societé Generale CIB acted as joint lead managers on the issue. These banks have been selected through competitive tendering to accompany the City of Paris in the process and to be partners. This way, the City of Paris can benefit from their expertise on investor expectations (e.g. to validate the use of proceeds, the framework and the selection of the projects of this bond), their network and marketing services (media relations, help in the organisation of the roadshow, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Paris climate bond is a real success: it was funded by a lot of investors, more than expected, and at the beginning there were applications of investors worth €475 million to fund the bond. At the moment, more than 30 investors are involved. The bond is mainly supported by domestic investors (83%), but the City of Paris managed to diversify its investor base to international institutional accounts, in particular to Benelux (9%), Switzerland (3%) and Nordics (3%). Insurers and pension funds bought the lion’s share of the trade (51%), followed by asset managers (49%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teams have been formed within the city administration to execute the projects under the bond, with the greenery department of the City being responsible for the realization of the adaptation measures. This department is divided in four working units for different parts of Paris, ensuring a more or less equal spreading of the trees and parks over the Paris area. Some projects will be newly designed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adaptation Strategy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paris’s strategy for adaptation is based on extensive research on the risks of climate change (conducted with Météo-France) in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of Paris in dealing with these changes and the scarcity of resources and is developed in collaboration with over one hundred Parisian stakeholders. In addition, proposals for action were received from all of the City of Paris departments and a public consultation was held in 2015 on adaptation to climate change, which all contributed to the development of the strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greening the city is a very well-known desire of Parisians that appears at the top-most projects suggested in the city’s participatory budgets (i.e. a share of the overall annual budget that is dedicated to implementing actions suggested by Parisians). For instance, the campaign “Du vert près de chez moi” (“green next to where I live”), where Parisians could suggest places to green (e.g. plant a tree, create a green wall) was very popular. More than 4,000 suggestions for places were received and 209 sites were chosen to green by 2020. It is, therefore, not necessary to further directly involve Parisians in the selection of the projects in the bond or to consult them about places for the new trees and plants as part of the two projects currently under execution.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Part of the plans for the new parks and trees were existing for a long time already, waiting for the financing to become available for their implementation. The idea for a climate bond also existed already in the Environment Department of the city of Paris for many years. The timing was right when the COP21 was held in Paris allowing the climate bond to become reality. A few important elements have to be taken into account when considering a green or climate bond:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Firstly, a green or climate bond is a long process. Selecting projects which match with numerous criteria requires many human resources and time. This might be more difficult to organize within smaller authorities. The advantage is that it creates a real internal synergy (financial matter and operational projects need each other).</li>
<li>Secondly, transparency and accountability are key words of the process. The process may imply a different working organization or may require new procedures or tools (for instance, for budget monitoring). It also costs money; to acquire extra-financial rating, to hire support for the creation and structure of this kind of bond, to mobilize a team, etc. In addition, the issuer of the green or climate bond has to report on the climate benefits. Paris has internal expertise within the Urban Ecology Agency (AEU) which is accredited for carbon evaluation, but if this competence is not present, it will have to be purchased externally.</li>
<li>Thirdly, independent advisors, sectoral experts in green or climate bonds and bankers seem necessary to erect an attractive green bond. In the opinion of investors, independence (or second opinion) guarantees security and an honest process. Furthermore, it is essential that the local authority has expertise on the green market and has knowledge of what is expected or valued by investors.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">For Paris this worked out well with regard to the applied methodology (clear financial framework, expert project managers attached to the various investment lines, well-structured use of proceeds, frequent reporting), collaboration (including each participant, even external ones, in the process with clear responsibilities) and coordination by the financial office. The city did not have all the required knowledge and resources in-house, but they knew where to get it and this input proved very valuable. Paris has, for example, an efficient network with bankers as they regularly trade with them. It is then crucial to connect all these different expertise and the city was successful at this due to internal competences. If the connection is not being made, which is especially difficult if all expertise are external to the local authority, this could become a serious impediment to launch a green bond. However, this connection is also what makes the process interesting as it creates synergy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, another important factor of success was the rating by Vigeo, which rated Paris as the leader of the sector in climate bonds (1st among local authorities) and made Paris attractive for investors.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A climate bond is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation or adaptation-related projects or programmes. A bond is a form of loan: the holder of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the borrower (debtor), in this case the City of Paris. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long term investments. The issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) and/or to repay the principal at a later date. Bonds are risk-weighted and credit rated in the usual way based on the creditworthiness of the issuer, and tradable, marked conditions permitting, in international secondary bond markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total size of the climate bond of Paris is €300 million and promises an annual interest rate of 1.75%. The bond is broken down as follows: €120 million for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, €115 million for energy efficiency, €5 million for production of renewable and/or recovered energy and €60 million for adaptation to climate change. The climate bond can be renewed every year, allowing new money to come in for more projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 20,000 trees that are being planted will cost €18 million in total. These costs will be financed for €15 million from the proceeds of the climate bond with the remaining €3 million directly financed from the greening budget of the City of Paris (Green spaces and Environment Department). The new parks will costs €67 million, of which €45 million will be financed by the climate bond and the rest again directly from the city’s greening budget. This greening budget is set independently from the adaptation strategy. There is at the moment no specific budget on adaptation at the city, other than a research budget. Maintenance of the parks and trees will be paid by the city as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation projects will not lead to direct financial benefits that will help reimbursing the investors, but through the mitigation projects in the bond and under the Paris Climate and Energy Action Plan, the City of Paris expects to reduce its energy consumption and thus generate extra revenue for the City. As it is not allowed to earmark revenues for specific expenditures (rule of non-assignment), this revenue will not be used directly to pay interest to the investors of the bond and repay them the full amount borrowed at the end of the bond term, but this will be paid out of the general City budget.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The climate bond is in line with the Paris ‘Climate &#38; Energy Action Plan’ and the ’Paris Adaptation Strategy’ which form the policy and legal basis for the bond. The Climate Action Plan, adopted in 2007, was updated in 2012 with the adoption of the Main Guidelines of the Paris Climate and Energy Action Plan, unanimously approved by the Council of Paris. The development of such a plan is imposed by Article 75 of the Law of 12 July 2009 on France’s Commitment to the Environment, which states that by 31 December 2012, all authorities of more than 50,000 inhabitants must adopt a Local Climate and Energy Plan (PCET) compatible with the Regional Climate-Air-Energy Strategy (SRCAE) adopted at regional level. The Paris Climate &#38; Energy Action Plan sets the general guidelines for climate and energy for Paris and it is broken down into different operational documents, including the Paris Adaptation Strategy. The Adaptation Strategy is a roadmap for adaptation and consists of 30 objectives applied in 35 actions, among others the objective to facilitate access to refreshing areas in summer, to cool off the city during peaks in temperature and to facilitate that by 2020, no Parisian should be more than a 7-minute walk from a place to relax with water and greenery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The climate bond is compliant with the Green Bond Principles, stating that: ‘Green projects are defined as projects and activities that will promote progress on environmentally sustainable activities as defined by the issuer and in line with the issuer’s project process for evaluation and selection. The management of green bond proceeds should be traceable within the issuing organization and issuers should report at least annually on use of proceeds. The Mayor of Paris has instructed the responsible deputy mayors by letter to implement the actions connected to the climate bond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Paris is responsible for the interest payments and full repayment at the end of the bond term. The climate bond is integrated in Paris' Euro Medium Term Note and is considered as a classic bond issue. In case interest or full reimbursement cannot be paid or is delayed, rules of the Base Prospectus will apply. In addition, the bondholders' group has chosen a representative who has authority to act on behalf of all bondholders to put their rights into effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to article L. 1612-4 of the General Code for Local Authorities (CGCT), borrowing should not under any circumstances be used to plug a financial hole in operating and investment finances or for debt amortization. Like any other loan, interests are paid with the operating resources (which in this case mean resources collected by the local authority, such as local taxation and financial transfers from the State to local authorities).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned before, maintenance of the climate bond projects cannot be paid from the bond, as it stated by law that a local community has to clearly separate finances for operational purposes from investment. According to article L. 2331-8 of the CGCT, the proceeds from a loan (bond) are a form of non-tax revenues from an investment, which means that it cannot be used to pay for operational expenditures like maintenance or operating costs.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The running time of the Paris climate bond is from 18 November 2015 to 25 May 2031. Both adaptation projects that have currently been included in the bond have to be realised by 2020.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Wetland adaptation in Attica Region, Greece]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The strategy and action plan for the wetland ecosystems in Attica Region (Greece) were developed in the OrientGate project by the Environmental Department of Attica Regional Authority with the scientific support of the Greek Biotope Wetland Centre (EKBY). Based on projections of future drought episodes, as well as on information from operational programmes and actions that are in progress or scheduled by various institutions and organisations, the strategy sets the vision and commitment to conservation and adaptation to climate change of the Attica’s wetlands to increase its resilience and reduce biodiversity loss, while making better use of ecosystem services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The strategy is built on seven axes under which measures with specific priority actions have been determined: the Attica Wetland Action Plan. This strategy also includes some over-arching elements: sustainable management and restoration of wetlands; their interconnection in a “green arc”; the evaluation of the services provided; awareness raising and environmental education in biodiversity and climate change, and citizen participation. The Attica Regional Authority drafted a road map to promote the implementation of selected actions of the Plan under the new National Strategic Reference Framework 2014-2020 or under other funding sources. From September 2015, a project entitled “Improving knowledge and increasing awareness for wetland restoration in Attica Region” is already implementing priority actions”.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Region of Attica is called on to combine the needs arising from human overpopulation, various human activities and often competitive land use through the proper and sustainable management and protection of the natural environment. Wetlands constitute a significant element of the natural environment, not only as ecosystems for the conservation of different species, but also as part of the water bodies of the region, as recreational areas or even as areas for the development of economic activities, which must be managed and protected by the state. Within the territory of the Region of Attica, there are still more than 100 wetlands including: streams and their estuaries, coastal marshes and lagoons, lakes and constructed wetlands. They now constitute “biodiversity islands” within a broadly degraded environment and offer the inhabitants of the Attica Region the opportunity to stay in touch with nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate Change is expected to put an additional pressure on these habitats as, based on future climate projections (emission scenarios A1B and A2 were considered by the OrientGate project), Attica’s vulnerability to drought is expected to rise from low to moderate by the year 2100. Drought episodes are expected to last longer and occur more frequently than in the past. This phenomenon is expected to have a serious impact on Attica wetlands as most of them are rain-fed. Further, due to the synergy of deteriorating drought conditions and anthropogenic interventions, most of Attica's wetlands are expected to suffer moderate to high impacts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, findings show that the agencies involved in the conservation of Attica wetlands have a medium-level adaptive capacity. In particular, there is inadequate knowledge of wetland ecosystems and their services, a lack of experience in the use and interpretation of climatic parameters, a low degree of networking and exchange of experiences and good practices, medium-level operational capacity of the competent agencies and availability of funds for the implementation of adaptation measures. In parallel, however, society is gaining a high level of understanding of the role played by wetlands in the quality of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of conserving the wetlands of Attica, it is deemed necessary to adopt an adaptation strategy and an action plan which is expected to reduce the impacts on wetlands of the combined effects of anthropogenic interventions and climate change and improve the capacity of involved stakeholders to cope with climate change.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In Attica, more than 100 wetlands have been recorded, which include streams and estuaries, coastal marshes and lagoons, lakes and artificial wetlands. Their importance lies in their ecological and conservation values, as well as ecosystem services to human well-being. Wetland conservation and/or restoration, their use for recreation and environmental interpretation and their connection to a "green belt" in the Attica Region are strategic priorities in view of upgrading the environment and improving the quality of life of citizens of Attica Region. The goal of the OrientGate project was to produce a climate change adaptation strategy and an action plan, which: (i) involve monitoring and assessing of the environmental quality of wetland areas in Attica Region, (ii) study drought deterioration in the future and (iii) put in force the implementation of a series of measures that reduce regional vulnerability of wetlands to climate change.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Strategy is built on seven axes under which measures along with specific priority measures have been determined in the “Attica Wetland Action Plan”:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>AXIS I - Improvement of knowledge for Attica wetlands and the effects of climate change: Measure Ι-1: Improve knowledge; Measure Ι-2: Ensure access to data and information and monitor the implementation of the Strategy.</li>
<li>AXIS II - Conservation and restoration of Attica wetland ecosystems and their services and adaptation to climate change: Measure ΙΙ-1: Delineate wetlands and designate protected areas; Measure ΙΙ-2: Protect, guard, conserve and restore; Measure ΙΙ-3: Conserve and manage sustainably wetlands of the Natura 2000 network.</li>
<li>AXIS III - Sustainable use of water resources: Measure ΙΙΙ-1: Prevent and abate industrial pollution.</li>
<li>AXIS IV - Land use regulations: Measure ΙV-1: Promote the concept of compact and non-polluting city.</li>
<li>AXIS V - Information, awareness, and ecotourism: Measure V-1: Strengthen public information and awareness programs for wetlands in Attica and climate change adaptation; Measure V-2: Education for wetlands and climate change adaptation; Measure V-3: Highlight the wealth of wetlands in Attica, improve recreation and ecotourism opportunities.</li>
<li>AXIS VI - Improvement of adaptive capacity in regard to wetland conservation and management: Measure VI-1: Improve capacity of public administration and local authorities.</li>
<li>AXIS VII - Integration of wetland conservation in enterprises: Measure VIΙ-1: Promote wetland conservation and innovative best practices in entrepreneurship.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">From September 2015, a project entitled “Improving knowledge and increasing awareness for wetland restoration in Attica Region“, is running (co-financed from the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism). Within the project priority actions under Measure I-1 and Measure II-1 are being carried including: (i) Scientific documentation of boundaries delineation of 50 Attica wetlands and development of a draft Presidential Degree for their legal designation according to Biodiversity national law; (ii) Determination of restoration actions for two highly degraded wetland areas; (iii) Measurements on the quantitative status of water in the wetland of the National Park Schinias and development of rehabilitation proposals focusing on wetland water needs; (iv) Gathering and storing of inventory data in a freely accessible web database. Up to the end of the project (February 2017) three public events will be organized to demonstrate project findings and results and aware on wetland protection and climate change adaptation.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented as a CCA (Climate Change Adaptation) Measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the beginning of the OrientGate project, Attica Region, engaged a wide range of stakeholders and end users (e.g. central, regional and local services, other authorities, research agencies, environmental organisations and interested citizens) and implemented several awareness actions through media, workshops, training seminars, information meetings and interviews. Thus, the formulated wetland adaptation strategy and plan followed a participative process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of 2014, a training seminar “Adaptation strategy for Attica Wetlands: The assessment of wetland vulnerability index” and an open dissemination event were held. During the seminar, around 30 participants from public services of Attica Region, NGOs, research institutes, and foreign participants (from Serbia and Romania), received hands-on training on the Wetland Vulnerability Indicator assessment methodology. During the dissemination event, around 80 participants from public services and municipalities of Attica Region, central services of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, NGOS, research institutes and from other sectors such as archaeologists, received information on Attica wetland vulnerability due to expected increase of drought and on the adaptation action plan that should be implemented in the coming years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2015, Attica Region carried out the Green Week 20015 satellite event “Raising support to restore the wetland of Brexiza, in the Region of Attica, Greece”, during which almost 90 visitors have come in touch with the biodiversity of Brexiza wetland and the important archaeological site of the Roman great temple of the Egyptian gods. This event opened the dialogue on Brexiza wetland restoration and biodiversity protection and on implementation of the action plan of the newly published Strategy for Attica wetland conservation and adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All these events were organized by Attica Region and scientifically supported by the Greek Biotope Wetland Centre (EKBY). Participants were very much motivated and showed strong interest to increase their knowledge and capacity in order to become capable to take action towards climate change adaptation and wetland conservation.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The factors that were decisive for a successful design of the adaptation strategy and plan include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The coordinator of strategy and plan design was the Environment Directorate of the Region of Attica, which has – as a part of its responsibility to specify the environmental policy guidelines at the regional level – focused on the conservation and protection of wetland ecosystems in view of climate change.</li>
<li>The formulation of the wetland adaptation strategy and plan followed a participative process. There was early engagement and strong collaboration with various end users: central, regional and local services, other authorities, research agencies, environmental organisations and interested citizens. They were encouraged to take action through interviews, information meetings, workshops and training seminars. Experiences were exchanged; weaknesses and good/bad practices in the management and protection of Attica’s wetland wealth were recorded; and the value of conserving wetlands and the need to adapt to climate change were promoted.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">There were no significant hindering factors during the elaboration of the adaptation strategy and plan. However, limitations will need to be overcome at the implementation stage of the proposed wetland adaptation action plan. These have their roots in: availability of funds, operational capacity of involved services and bodies to take the proposed adaptation measures, regulation of land uses in view of wetland protection and restoration.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of the proposed action plan is expected to mitigate the impacts on Attica wetlands of the combined effects of anthropogenic interventions and climate change. Improved protection of wetlands is also expected to improve their ecosystem functions, such as: (i) protection of the coasts by reducing the effect of waves and currents; (ii) improvement of water quality by trapping sediments, nutrients and toxic substances; (iii) support to economic activities depending on wetland resources. Other positive outcomes that will derive from the implementation of the action plan include the:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Improvement of knowledge about climate change and its influence on wetland species, habitats and ecosystem functions;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Enhancement of environmental awareness and development of information centres.</li>
</ul>]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Legislation and strategic, policy and programming frameworks</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Attica Wetland Action Plan integrates measures and priority actions which are foreseen by the existing legislation and fall in existing national strategic, policy and programming frameworks, including:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The National Operational Plan for  the environment (2014-2020), which covers objectives and priority actions for: the waters and the implementation of the Water Management Plans; the conservation of nature and biodiversity through better management of NationalURA2000 sites; the promotion of ecosystem services and green infrastructures for climate change adaptation based on natural solutions and for the management of flood risk including actions for the creation of a hydrological database, public awareness, etc.</li>
<li>The national strategy and action programme on biodiversity, which highlights the need for wetland conservation and adaptation to climate change and includes priorities such as delineation, restoration, research on climate change effects on biodiversity and ecosystems, and promotion of biodiversity islands in urban environments as green infrastructures.</li>
<li>The national law on biodiversity and in particular the articles that cover the designation of wetlands as protected areas.</li>
<li>The Master Plan of Athens/Attica 2021, which lists Attica wetlands (including lakes, rivers, streams and their estuaries, springs, lagoons, and coastal marshes) and covers actions for their legal protection and their promotion as green infrastructures.</li>
<li>The River Basin Management Plan-Attica Water District (in the context of the Water Framework Directive implementation), which includes a specific measure for the restoration and promotion of Attica Wetlands.</li>
</ul><p><em>Institutional opportunities</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Region of Attica is a Metropolitan Region. It is the first region that has been mobilized towards a climate change adaptation strategy in regard to natural ecosystems, involving local authorities in its area, social groups, environmental organisations and research institutions for the protection of the wetlands in its jurisdiction. Municipalities of Attica Region are mobilized to take adaptation actions in the context of their local operational plans.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Public-private partnership for a new flood proof district in Bilbao]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bilbao’s ‘Zorrotzaurre’ district is currently a degraded, flood-prone industrial peninsula. With increasing extreme precipitation predicted across the Basque country in the future due to climate change and a need for new housing to accommodate citizens of Bilbao, a major urban regeneration project is currently underway to redevelop Zorrotzaurre district into a new flood-proof residential quarter. Flood protection includes five key measures: (1) opening the Deusto canal (turning the peninsula into an island), (2) providing a flood protection wall, (3) elevating the ground level by 1,5 meters for new buildings, (4) installing storm water tanks and (5) providing green, public spaces. To realise this urban regeneration project, a public-private partnership was established for financing and managing the plan. The costs for the redevelopment works will be covered by the public-private partnership, i.e. the owners of the land, according to their share of ownership.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bilbao is situated in the Nerbioi valley through which the Nerbioi River flows, influenced by ocean tides. Today, river flooding is already the most common threat in the valley caused mainly by increased runoff due to land cover changes related to inadequate forest management, intensive cattle raising and recreational practices, as well as by Bilbao’s urban sprawl. Costs incurred by Bilbao’s metropolitan area associated with river flood events have been estimated at €5.5 million for a once in 10 year rainfall event (T=10), €241 million for a once in 100 year event (T=100), and €444 million for a once in 500 year rainfall event (T=500) (lower range of estimates).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on regional climate models predicting a 10% increase in extreme precipitation events across the Basque Country, the threat of flooding will likely increase in the future. It is also estimated that the peak flow of the Nerbioi River in 2050 will have risen by 22%, which in turn could mean that the area at risk of flooding may expand by 3%. While this figure sounds minor, it can have disastrous effects on houses, industrial areas and agricultural land in the area concerned. In addition, a rising sea level accompanied by higher tides will aggravate the flooding potential along the estuary. Consequently, taking climate change into account, the expected damage costs incurred by the heightened flood risk of Bilbao’s metropolitan area may rise by 56.4% compared to the current estimates listed above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More generally, Bilbao is a city with a thriving economy and an expanding service sector. As a consequence, the city faces a high demand for new housing units and related infrastructures. As Bilbao is located in a valley, it has little space to expand and solutions must be found within the current built environment. Zorrotzaurre, an abandoned industrial peninsula situated in the Nerbioi River, therefore provides an interesting opportunity and its development plan includes the construction of 5.473 new dwellings and 202.129 square meters of construction for economic activity (25% of the total surface area).</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the redevelopment project is to turn Zorrotzaurre from an industrial site to a residential area. This first and foremost requires adequate protection from flooding. Objectives with regards to flooding have been defined as: existing houses in Zorrotzaurre should be well protected for T=100 rainfall events: new buildings/housing should withstand T=500 events.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to create a balanced urban development, 50% of new housing units will be allocated as social housing and sold at a later stage. The new quarter will be well-connected to the rest of the city, equipped with affordable housing, areas for environmentally-friendly industry and two thirds of Zorrotzaurre will be reserved for public uses, including open green areas to be enjoyed by the local community and visitors alike and public facilities for educational, health, sport and cultural uses. The formation of this "mix" of residential (housing), public and economic activities aim to reduce mobility needs of the quarter’s inhabitants and stimulate space for artistic and creative innovation. Hence, Zorrotzaurre aims to grow into a ‘creative island’. To protect Zorrotzaurre from flooding, several measures are being taken:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Opening up the Deusto canal</strong>. The opening of the canal reduces the flood potential by creating increased water capacity and thereby decreasing the height of the water surface. Studies show that the opening of the canal greatly reduces the risk of flooding in Zorrotzaurre as well as other urban areas (e.g. Botika Vieja, Euskalduna, Abandoibarra, and Campo Volantín) including the historic centre of Bilbao higher upstream. With this adaptation measure in place, decreases of flood levels between 1 and 0.5 meter can be achieved. Similarly, the Research Center for Climate Change, BC3, has conducted a study concluding that the opening of the canal would generate a considerable reduction in the expected economic damage from flooding events in Bilbao (see ‘costs and benefits’). It should also be noted that the opening of the canal will turn the peninsula into an island.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Elevation of the ground level</strong>. During the first phase of the project the surface in the east and west of the Zorrotzaurre peninsula/island will be elevated by 1.5 meters so that new buildings can be constructed on a higher level. This should protect the new buildings from T=500 rainfall events.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Construction of a flood protection wall</strong>. To protect the 47 existing buildings (including 352 apartments) on the peninsula, mostly locat-ed next to the river, a 1 meter high flood protection barrier will be constructed. This barrier should ensure that existing buildings are protected from flooding from T=100 rainfall events.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Green, open spaces</strong>. The 7.5 km long river bank will mostly (95%) be 20 meter wide public space for pedestrians and bikers, partly at the current level and partly at the elevated level. Some of this area can be used as an overflow area for the river. The green open spaces are concentrated on both edges of the island and on the canal side, with major walkways on both banks of the canal, as well as a linear park of 40,000 square meters in the central area of the island. The gardens of Botica Vieja on the opposite side of the canal will be extended and increased in size and con-nected by the new bridges to the open spaces on the Zorrotzaurre island. The network is complemented with “green fingers” of more than 5.000 square meters extending across the island from the canal to the pathway located on the riverbank.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Provision of storm water tanks</strong>. In addition to the measures above, 3 storm water tanks will be provided to store excess water, one in San Ignacio (620 cubic meters) and two in Ribera de Duesto (2.100 cubic meters each) (two neighbourhoods on the other side of the canal).</li>
</ul>]]></field_solutions>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main stakeholders of the redevelopment project, the land owners of Zorrotzaurre, created  the public-private partnership, the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ (the Management Commission of Zorrotzaurre) as a necessary element to advance the project. The private sector initiated the partnership, and, due to the importance of the project and the amount of land owned by public authorities (Port, City and Province), the public sector joined the ‘Comisión Gestora’. The ‘Comisión Gestora’ is a union of owners with no special legal status. The ‘Junta de Concertación’, the organization that was created to develop the first phase of the project, is an organisation defined in the Basque law for urbanism. Both are not-for-profit, since the final objective is to balance the costs with investments made by the owners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The current members of the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ own 65% of the land in Zorrotzaurre; these are: The Regional Basque Government (through the Department of Employment and Social Affairs and the publicly-owned company Visesa), Bilbao City Council, the Port Authority of Bilbao, and private entities ‘Sociedad Promotora Inmobiliaria Margen Derecha S.A.’ and ‘Vicinay Cadenas S.A.’. The ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ supervises the redevelopment plan of Zorrotzaurre (the ‘Master Plan Zorrotzaurre’) and the members pay for all the expenses of the project and contribute financially relative to the share of land they own (51% public, 49% private).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The residents of Zorrotzaurre are excluded from membership as they are not supposed to pay for any costs of the project. However, they, together with the neighbourhood association, have been involved in the design and development of the plans for which various interactions with the project managers have taken place. Among the results of these discussion has been a programme established by the ‘Society for Municipal Restoration’, or Surbisa, with a ring-fenced budget (donated 50% by developers of the general project and 50% by the municipality) to support and help existing owners and tenants to restore their buildings with special attention to improve accessibility and energy saving. Surbisa is a municipal company, owned 100% by the City. The Boards consists of all parties that have an elected member in the City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the redevelopment plan has had two periods of public exposure where 38 and 10 claims respectively were received from citizens of Bilbao. As a result of the claims, a number of modifications were introduced into the initial planning approach, some of a minor nature and others more fundamental, like the decision to maintain the former industrial building known as the ‘Papelera’, which is located on the Deusto riverbank. Citizens wanted to maintain this historic building and it will now be converted into a cultural centre.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The redevelopment of Zorrotzaurre is a slow and complex project which was also affected by the economic crisis that unfolded since the publication of the revised plan in 2007. Therefore, instead of carrying out the entire project at once, it was decided to split the plan for the peninsula/island into two areas and these two spatial plans then have been further divided into phased development. Several factors make up the complexity of the project and delay its execution:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The great number of stakeholders involved, including the municipality, land owners and residents.</li>
<li>Soil pollution: because of previous industrial activities, the soil in some areas is polluted and will need to be decontaminated before construction work can start (this is being paid by the companies that caused it, or by the current land owners if the former do not exist anymore).</li>
<li>Moving industries: the plan also involves the demolishment of several buildings and the relocation of 30 companies to other locations outside of Zorrotzaurre. For this, a special plan and a sub-project have been created, the so-called ‘Re-Allotment project’, which also consisted of gathering funds within the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ to compensate the parties involved. The compensation and ample preparation time for the relocation meant that very few problems have been encountered in the end with the parties concerned.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, one of the greatest assets to the project is the investment vehicle that has been concluded: the great number of land owners of all sizes gathered in the public-private partnership (the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’). The partnership includes a Coordination Board and a Management Board, which oversees the execution of the works and facilitates the coordination and operation of the project.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The costs for opening the Deusto canal are budgeted at €20.9 million. The City Council takes up this spending as they reached an agreement with the Basque government that the Basque country in turn will finance the costs of one of the new bridges. The municipality will also pay for the flood protection barrier (€5.1 million, including the structural rehabilitation of the river bank) and the storm water tanks (costs estimated at €4.74 million), as agreed between the municipality and the ‘Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’. The costs for the ground level elevation and public, green spaces (as well as the other redevelopment costs) are paid by the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’, the public-private partnership that has been erected for the redevelopment of Zorrotzaurre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All flood protection solutions together have been estimated to: (i) eliminate the damage costs associated with T=10 rainfall events; and (ii) reduce damage costs for T=100 and T=500 events by about 67% and 30% respectively.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Master Plan for Urban Planning in Bilbao’, approved in 1995 (and being updated in 2016), includes the land use change of Zorrotzaurre from industrial to residential, with 50% social housing and ample public facilities (cultural, educational, recreational). The corresponding ‘Master Plan for Zorrotzaurre’ for the project was drawn up in 2004, revised in 2007, and designed by the prestigious architect Zaha Hadid . On November 29th 2012, the Bilbao City Council gave definitive approval to the ‘Master Plan for Zorrotzaurre’. The City of Bilbao is responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ is a private organization, involving public and private owners of the land on Zorrotzaurre. The task of the ’Comisión Gestora de Zorrotzaurre’ is to make the decisions necessary to advance the work and achieve the plan’s objectives, as well as to resolve problems that may arise during the implementation. The executive decisions are taken by the members of the organization’s Management Board, who are representatives, at the highest level, of the property owners. The Coordination Board, on the other hand, is responsible for the daily operations and it regularly reports to the Management Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptation objectives of the ‘Master Plan Zorrotzaurre’ are backed by the national and regional adaptation strategies. The Ministry for the Environment of the Government of Spain issued a ‘Spanish Strategy for Climate Change and Clean Energy’ 2007 laying out its plans until 2020. The Basque Country has followed and in 2015 adopted the ‘Basque Climate Change Strategy 2050’. Whilst the implications of the latter for the Basque municipalities are yet to be seen, both strategies provide an incentive to do more at local level to prevent impacts from climate change.</p>

    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge over the canal has been constructed (2016) and work on the opening of the canal is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. The urban redevelopment of the island will commence in 2017 and is not expected to be finished within 30 years.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Implementing climate change allowances in drainage standards across the UK railway network]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK is generally projected to experience increases in precipitation as a result of climate change. An important resilience action to mitigate the impacts from such increases is improvements in drainage management. Climate change resilience within Network Rail, the national railway infrastructure manager in Great Britain, is driven by corporate strategic objectives within the Network Rail Sustainable Development strategy. Recently, Network Rail published eight Route Weather Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation plans covering the whole rail network. The plans reflect upon the impacts from weather variability, regional climate change projections and actions being taken to increase resilience; including investment in drainage systems and implementation of an Integrated Drainage Management Policy.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The effective control of water is essential for the management of infrastructure to support safe and efficient railway services. Water has a role in many degradation mechanisms that affect infrastructure; such as the scour of bridges and embankments, and the long-term softening of materials that form the Track Support System. Drainage problems can result in speed restrictions or temporary closures of the line, as well as increasing maintenance costs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">In accordance with its Asset Management Capability report (Network Rail, 2014), Network Rail is addressing different climate-related challenges, including increases in average and maximum daily temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and occasionally very cold winter conditions. NR's drainage policy is addressing some of them: in the last years, NR has developed a coherent policy across the drainage system and has started to improve the asset information held on the drainage system. Within the current Control Period (2014-2019, CP5), Network Rail will continue to pursue improved assets knowledge, and to seek a clearer understanding of how changes in rainfall intensity and frequency will impact on new asset specification and maintenance regimes.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change resilience within Network Rail, the national railway infrastructure manager in Great Britain, is driven by corporate strategic objectives within the Network Rail Sustainable Development strategy:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand the current weather resilience, and seek to optimise resilience and enhance adaptation capability;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Develop a thorough understanding of the potential impacts of climate change in terms of infrastructure performance, safety risks and costs;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Embed climate change adaptation within asset policies and investment decisions;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Communicate the role the rail network plays in supporting weather and climate resilience across Great Britain, and support efforts to increase national resilience.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">To be effective, railway drainage systems need to be designed and built to appropriate standards, maintained regularly and, when required, improved. The revision and implementation of the drainage standards is a key asset management instrument within Network Rail's drainage policy. The drainage standards adopt a precautionary approach, by increasing the design flow and providing further capacity in new and refurbished drainage systems. The implementation of climate change allowances is a part of the solution for Network Rail to increase weather and climate change resilience. Asset policy revision, technology adoption and root cause analysis are also essential actions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Network Rail developed its current Railway Drainage Systems Manual in 2010. The document set standards that include allowances for impacts from future climate in the design of railway assets. For new and remediated railway drainage, a 20% increase in the estimated present day design flow for design event return periods is added. This addition is consistent with the recommendations for climate change allowances for flood and coastal risk management provided by the UK Government, and more specifically by England’s Environment Agency.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The drainage standards are applied across the network; however the location-specific nature of weather impacts will require analysis and response at route level to ensure investment in drainage is cost effective. The Scotland Route Weather Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation Plan (Network Rail, 2014) reports on some concrete actions already undertaken:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">The flood site at Dalmarnock Station has been remediated through major works by providing an attenuation system.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">The flood site at Drem station has been remediated under a Business Plan with a new pipe work and an attenuation pond.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Remediation of the flood site at Penmanshiel siphon is still ongoing. Initial remediation was provided through enhanced inspection and cleaning. A major works scheme to raise the wall heads of siphon chamber and install new screens has being completed. Further enhancement to provide an attenuation pond is planned during CP5 (Control Period (2014-2019).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Improved drainage management capability is also being achieved by Network Rail through new mobile works tools and improvements in NR's drainage competency during 2014.</div>
</li>
</ul><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Drainage standards are also applied in new projects, such as the 30-mile "borders rail" project, linking Edinburgh to Tweedbank. This is the longest domestic railway being constructed in the UK in the last 100 years, and is expected to open in Summer 2015 (Borders Railway, 2014). Network Rail is further strengthening its drainage policy in CP5. It has developed a coherent policy across the drainage system, and improved the asset information held on drainage system. In future, Network Rail will seek a clearer understanding of how changes in rainfall intensity will impact on new asset specification and maintenance regimes.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Network Rail presents progress to railway industry stakeholders through many forums. The delivery of drainage plans is specifically monitored internally and by the Office of Rail Regulation. Network Rail liaises with England, Wales and Scotland environment agencies.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Success factors include: (i) Long-term vision and strategy; (ii) Collaborative relationships with stakeholders; (iii) Robust asset management policies and compliance processes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The main limiting factors are related to the complexity and extension of the British rail system. Upgrading of current drainage conditions to the new standards will need to be accommodated to the availability of resources, and action will have to be prioritised accordingly. Furthermore, the decisions taken may have system wide implications, as activity on one asset group (such as track, for drainage), may impact on another part of the overall railway system (e.g. signalling).</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[White roof, innovative solar shadings and bioclimatic design in Madrid]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change impacts which are expected to be very relevant for the Madrid region include extreme heat in summer, water scarcity and sometimes, heavy rainfall. In 2012, the new building of the energy department of the Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies (IMDEA) was delivered. The new building, located in Móstoles 18 kilometres southwest from central Madrid, incorporates different climate change adaptation solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the design, climate adaptation measures often have a simultaneous climate mitigation effect. The building has been designed according to the criteria of bioclimatic architecture, in order to achieve low indoor temperatures during hot periods and minimise energy use for cooling and lighting. Climate adaptation measures have also been developed with respect to water management. Water-saving systems are implemented and all the water from the roof is collected to irrigate green areas or for other non-specified purposes. Not only extreme droughts, but also extreme rainfalls are taken into account; the parking has a permeable surface, which drains water quickly after the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate mitigation measures focus mainly on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and reduced energy consumption. In addition to make efficient use of available (renewable) energy sources, the building focuses on efficiency and versatility by its architectural structure. Resource efficiency during the building construction was another important focus of the project.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge of the project was to develop a building which would have to meet a combination of numerous ambitious aims: it had to become a large, multifunctional, flexible, energy efficient and climate adaptive building that would last for a long time. Climate change impacts like extreme heat, water scarcity and incidentally heavy rainfall are expected to become more and more serious problems for the Madrid region in the coming decades. The building had to be adapted to those circumstances.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the objective of the energy department of the IMDEA institute is to carry out research and development on energy issues (especially concerning renewable energy and clean energy solutions), a connection to these overarching goals was considered in the design of the new building. At the same time the developers aimed to design a building that would operate for a long time and that would function under changed climatic conditions, with higher summer temperatures and without consuming additional energy for cooling. The building design had to include energy efficient systems, renewable energy, reduced energy use, efficient water systems, efficient resource use and green areas around the building.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the solutions implemented in the construction of the IMDEA building are climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building has been designed according to the criteria of bioclimatic architecture, in order to achieve low indoor temperatures during hot periods and minimise energy use for cooling and lighting. Building facades are back-ventilated with 80 mm isolation and different exterior finishes for optimal result. It is enveloped by large transparent surfaces, especially in the indoor walls, which improve the appearance and energy quality of the building as more radiation reaches its interior. Horizontal blades (“fixed large louvre blade system”) are used on the outside of the building, thereby offering effective solar shading without impairing the view. These sunshades protect the users against an excessive level of heat due to solar radiation or the possibility of glare when the solar altitude is at its highest or when the levels of radiation are very high. Together with a proper orientation of the building, the sunshades enable optimal use of the incoming light in times of low solar altitude (early morning, late evening and winter days). Roof areas exposed to direct sun have been covered with special white material reflecting radiations, which reduces the amount of energy needed for cooling and the contribution to the urban heat island effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation measures have also been developed with respect to water management. Water-saving systems are implemented; for example sinks, toilets and urinals are very low water consuming and the saving is over 40% compared to a conventional building. Additionally, all the water from the roof is collected and used to irrigate green areas or for other non-specified purposes. Not only extreme droughts, but also extreme rainfalls are taken into account; the parking has a permeable surface, which drains water quickly after the event. Attention is also paid to the biodiversity and nature value of the area. The green area surrounding the building is covered with local trees and plants and counts for more than 40% of the total area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The climate mitigation measures that have been taken in consideration focus mainly on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and reduced energy consumption. The building has energy efficient facilities and a monitoring and control system to ensure optimal use of those facilities. Three years after its completion, the building has become more energy efficient every year, due to this monitoring system. A closed system of water cooling also supports the energy and water efficiency of the building. An aquifer thermal energy storage installation, cogeneration and solar panels are installed as renewable energy sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to making efficient use of available (renewable) energy sources, the building focuses on efficiency and versatility by its architectural structure. Special care has been taken in the orientation of the building: different facade systems have been designed and compared in order to develop the optimal facade according to function and orientation. The building was designed in modules, so it could be expanded or divided without affecting its functionality or image. The core of the building literally forms the heart of the building and is designed as a natural meeting and interaction place. The research buildings are placed around it. In those buildings the technical equipment is placed on top, thereby forming a passive defence cover against excessive solar radiation and heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Resource efficiency was another important focus of the project. During construction, recycled materials have been used, such as steel, aluminium or glass; as well as locally made components, such as natural stone, concrete and ceramic materials. Sustainability of the materials was also an important issue and therefore the materials derived from wood have the FSC certificate. The whole IMDEA building was designed and developed according to the Green Building specifications (established by the US Green Building Council) and obtained the LEED Gold Certification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change mitigating measures are also implemented via behavioural measures; electric cars and carpooling are encouraged by the reservation of special places on the IMDEA parking area.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation was not directly relevant for the design and construction of the new building of the energy department of IMDEA. The following key actors were involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was initiated by the IMDEA institute (Fundación IMDEA Energía). In Spain, building projects are usually governed by one party and in this case this supervising party was the architect company Arkitools. The construction company was SACYR. Several different consultants participated in the project: HCA (structures consultants), OFINCO (installations consultants), INITEC (installations consultants) and EUROCONSULT (project management). VEGA INGENIERÍA assisted in the LEED certification process. The municipality of Móstoles, the city where the IMDEA building is located, supported the project by ceding the land for free.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The time and attention paid to designing the building have led to a thoroughly developed building plan. It started as a relative simple design, but evolved during the designing process with an increase in energy efficiency targets over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another success factor was that the project focused on an integrated design instead of a straightforward addition of individual techniques. For example, solar panels have been installed in the roof directly instead of adding them at a later stage. Another example is that during the soil testing for the foundations, simultaneously tests have been performed for the aquifer thermal energy storage potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the beginning of the project the climate, energy and sustainability targets were very low but they evolved over the course of the project. The continuous updating of the targets and measures lengthened the project development time considerably.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction cost was about 9.2 million of euros. No subsidy was given directly by the city or the region, but since the IMDEA institute is created by the Community of Madrid, this building project is indirectly funded by the autonomous community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IMDEA has received funding from calls for Science and Technology of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, although it is unknown how much funding was received. IMDEA has also received funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), through an agreement signed between the Ministry of Economy and Innovation and the Community of Madrid, but it is unclear how much of the funding was dedicated to the building and how much to the research work; in total, the funding is in the order of magnitude of millions of euros.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new building did not just cost money, but it is meant to save money during the period of use. The high energy and water efficiency of the building can result in lower future costs for energy and water consumption compared to conventional buildings. This potential cost reduction is not quantified.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Heatwave plan for England]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2003, a 10 day heatwave period caused over 2,000 excess deaths (compared to the same dates in the previous five years) in UK. As a response, the heatwave plan for England was first issued in 2014 and has since undergone annual updates (last update in May 2016 has not introduced changes to 2015 version that therefore it is the one still valid). The plan intends to protect the population from heat-related harm to health. It aims to prepare for, alert people to, and prevent, the major avoidable effects on health during periods of severe heat. It allows a structured reaction to five urgency levels (from long-term preparation to immediate relief action), monitored through a seasonal heat-health watch system. The plan is a template for appropriate local heatwave plans. While this plan already offers solutions for the present, it has been devised with future climate in mind. The expected increase in heatwaves and the resulting need for adaptation is illustrated in the accessory document “Making the case: the impact of heat on health – now and in the future”, stating that "[…] <em>unless we take steps now to plan for the longer term changes we will not be prepared. Moreover, these need to be taken on a multi-agency basis</em> […]". The plan suggests, e.g. the following adaptation focuses: i) urban heat islands, ii) green spaces for cool environments, iii) thermal insulation of homes, and iv) cooling health facilities.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[Action plan, early warning system, cross-sectoral, multi-agency, equality assessment, heat]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Heatwaves, among the various health hazards imposed by climate change, strike particularly hard in regions where the population is neither accustomed to high temperatures nor does expect them. Under these adverse circumstances, the UK faced an estimated 2.000 victims to the 2003 European heatwave. The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2012 (UK CCRA 2012) estimates an increase of annual heat-related deaths of up to 1,700 by the 2020s; moreover, the authors of the heatwave plan follow the IPCC’s assumption of a very likely increase in frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves. The authors also recognize the CCRA’s further conclusions that heatwaves "<em>may particularly affect vulnerable groups such as the elderly. South-east England may be the region most affected</em>".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, the authors acknowledged the CCRA’s indicated need for multi-agency <em>and</em> cross-sectoral adaptation planning, assuming a significant impact on health and wellbeing of other sectors like built environment or agriculture. Key challenges for improving future response to heatwaves were, thus:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">translating meteorological forecasts into regional, standardized alert codes;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">ensuring a rapid and clear cut alert chain from central forecast to local responders;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">ensuring co-ordinated cooperation among the various health service providers (including appropriate information of the public for autonomous protection).</li>
</ul>]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The objectives of the heatwave plan are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Strategic planning: coordinated long-term and multi-agency planning (the latter referring to a joint effort together with experts outside the health sector to, e.g., increase cooling capacity of the built environment).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A seasonal alert and information system to: (i) trigger the response of National Health Services, government and public health system, (ii) inform and advise health and social care professionals; information will be both preventive and tactic (upon forecast of a severe heatwave).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Heatwave and summer preparedness. Key tasks are: agreements on lead bodies at subnational level, reducing indoor heat exposure, preparedness of the health and social care system.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main measures implemented through the heatwave plan for England are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>A heat-health watch system</strong>: this alert system operates from June 1 to September 15. It receives temperature forecasts from the national meteorological office. Alert levels range from 0 (year-round long term planning) to 4 (national emergency: heat impacts extend beyond the health sector, according to national cross-sectoral judgement). Intermediate alerts (levels 2 and 3) are issued above 30 and 15 °C (day and night, respectively), threshold varying regionally. While heat-health watch is operative, Public Health England (PHE) monitors key outputs from real-time syndromic surveillance and shares these data with the health department (DH).</li>
<li><strong>Standardised meteorological heatwave warnings</strong>: these alert levels inform the health-health watch system (cf. above). Warnings are color-coded to indicate the affected region.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinated, multi-agency response</strong> through the inclusion of the UK local resilience forums (LRF; these are institutionalised response partnerships of local public services – including emergency services, local authorities, the National Health Service (NHS), the Environment Agency and others).<br />•    Information and training of the public and of health care professionals: the heatwave plan and its accompanying documents include concise and easily understandable advice for individual prevention measures – including peer-to-peer community help. A main tool are “<strong>action tables</strong>”, which are clearly laid out and comprehensible one-page for four different targeted audiences (national institutions to local citizens) allowing the rapid briefing about risks and countermeasures for each alert level. Public coverage is increased through dissemination via social media (Facebook, Twitter).</li>
<li><strong>Equality assessment</strong>: special emphasis was laid on safeguarding equality during prevention and aid, i.e. screening for groups which might be at particular risk for e.g. socio-economic reasons.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The heatwave plan for England offers solutions to cope with present climate variability and extreme events, which are highly relevant also to better adapt to future climate changes. In this perspective, the plan suggests a number of additional health-related adaptation options including: green spaces for cool environments, thermal insulation of homes, and cooling health facilities.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholder participation shapes the annual revisions of the heatwave plan through the input of expertise from relevant stakeholder groups and levels: these range from national government institutions to regional or local health care units. Likewise, the heatwave plan is supplemented by different special reports for particular stakeholder groups: (i) health and social care professionals, (ii) home managers and staff, (iii) teachers and supervisory staff, and (iv) citizens. The results of a dedicated equality analysis are publicly available, too.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In relation to the plan implementation the following success factors can be mentioned:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The heatwave plan considers and informs other relevant frameworks and strategies, like the Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF), Joint Strategic Needs Assignments (JSub National Regionss) and Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategies (JHWSs). This helps to align adaptation measures with technically related strategies and improve performance through synergies (exchange subject matter know-how and evidence, ensure convergence of measures, etc.)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The plan both supports and relies on local to regional agents, notably the LRF but also Local Health Resilience Partnerships, public health directors as local agenda-setters, or Local Health and Wellbeing Boards. This ensures swift and locally adequate response and cooperation among responders of administratively distinct forces.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The plan is updated on a yearly base (and endowed with supplementary dissemination material) as required by new developments (see e.g. <span><a href="http://www.birminghamprepared.gov.uk/news/national-heatwave-plan-for-england-2016/">2016 update</a></span>; this has not introduced changes to 2015 version that therefore it is the one still valid). This protects against outdated or insufficient response schemes as evidence and know-how continuously evolves during implementation.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptation to future warming, including prolonged peak temperature, highly benefits from the provision of subject-matter forecasting and alert chains. These deliver specific information to local multi-agency responders who can then prevent or at least minimise the costs (last not least concerning healthcare staff and facilities) otherwise incurred through lack of information or preparation. Note that local resilience forums – though implemented independently from the heatwave plan – promise a very useful concept for the implementation of cross-sectoral adaptation and disaster risk reduction, too.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Key health care responsibilities (and authority) – as during heatwaves – are stipulated in the UK parliament’s Health and Social Care Act 2012. The LRF, an integral operative part of the heatwave plan, are so-called Category 1 (or “core”) responders of the UK emergency planning &#38; response system, provided by the parliament’s Civil Contingencies Act 2004.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was first published on 13 May 2014. Updates of plan and/or supplements: 21 August 2014, 22 May 2015, 25 May 2016 (this last version does not introduce changes; thus 2015 one is the still valid version). The plan has been operative since May 2014.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Urban river restoration: a sustainable strategy for storm-water management in Lodz, Poland]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The 19th century industrialisation in Lodz heavily affected the city’s rivers altering their ecosystems and hydrology. Many rivers in the densely built-up city were canalized. This resulted in a higher flood risk from runoff during heavy rain periods. Low water retention also implies reduction of soil moisture during dry spells, contributing to higher temperature and reduced air humidity (urban heat island). As the projections suggest that the intensity of heavy rain periods and higher temperatures are likely to increase, these problems are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. In response, Lodz carried out several activities within the EU SWITCH project, as: 1) demonstration project of river restoration using natural processes, and 2) development of a new concept for the city planning, i.e. Blue-Green Network Concept. The developed strategy aims to: improve urban ecosystem health, reduce flood risk, and ameliorate the microclimate, thereby contributing to better quality of life.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Lodz, whose name in Polish means 'boat', is located in the source area of eighteen streams. The proximity to water enabled the city to become a major manufacturing centre in the 19th century. Lodz’s industrial past and urbanisation resulted in serious water management challenges for the city. The majority of the city’s urban streams were canalized and transformed in culvert pipes. This, combined with high proportion of impermeable surfaces in the city and a consequent reduced rainwater absorption capacity of the land, contributed to an increase in surface run-off and in the speed of water outflow. As a result, parts of the city are badly affected by flooding during storms, which projections suggest may increase in intensity under the changing climate. Large parts of the city have combined sewers, which means that during heavy rainfall the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant is exceeded, which in turn results in pollution of a receiving river. Degradation of the freshwater habitats resulting from pollution and the artificial character of rivers reduces their capacity for water retention and self-purification, leading in turn to poorer water and ecological quality. In addition, the lack of green spaces and open waterways in the city increases air pollution levels, reduces humidity and causes a considerable urban heat island effect. Together these affect the health and quality of life of Lodz’s inhabitants. As the temperature is expected to rise in the future, the need for cool and green environments capable of dealing with heavy rainfall will also increase.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Two major activities were undertaken in Lodz:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Elaboration and demonstration of the strategy and technology for restoration of municipal rivers based on natural processes, aiming at: improved storm-water management, increased water retention, and better water quality supporting higher biodiversity and improvement of quality of life.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Development of the system-wide approach to the city adaptation strategy based on the  Blue-Green Network Concept. This  assumes that river valleys and green spaces are connected in the city planning and development process, to create a framework for a friendly city, which retains water, supports green infrastructure, encourages society healthy lifestyles, attracts business, and become resilient to global climate change.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Adopted solutions include a demonstration project, implemented on the Sokołówka River, and the development of an overall approach to urban planning based on the Blue-Green Network concept. The SWITCH project introduced a multi-stakeholder (i.e. Learning Alliance) involving all the actors in the city having interest in the water and natural resources management as well as regional and national stakeholders. The multi-stakeholder approach with strong research elements resulted in application of the principles of ecohydrology (studying the interactions between water and ecosystems) and Integrated Urban Water Management in the demonstration project “restoration of the Sokołówka River”. The Sokołówka River which is mostly supplied by storm water outlets, runs partially in an artificial channel and is prone to algal blooms due to high content of nutrients in the storm water. The objectives of this restoration project were as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Apply innovative ecosystem biotechnologies according to the principles of eco-hydrology;</li>
<li>Increase the capacity of the river system to absorb the urbanisation impact (to increase water storage and purification capacity);</li>
<li>Restore the river functions to provide ecosystem services to the inhabitants.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The first step of the pilot project was the acquisition of accurate baseline data (e.g. chemical analysis of bottom sediments and water, biological and ecological data, river water budget and models for storm-water management) that were used to select the appropriate measures to be implemented. The results were used to design and construct three storm-water reservoirs (completed in 2006, 2009 and 2010) and a sequential sedimentation bio-filtration system for storm-water purification (completed in 2011) which was patented as a SWITCH innovation. The project led to a wider plan for rehabilitation of the Sokołówka river (the concept and technical project are finalised) and a plan for the development of Sokołówka River park (approved by the City Council and awaiting funding). The Sokołówka  River restoration project has contributed to resolving the following climate change related challenges:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Reduction of the storm-water sewage flow peaks by series of ponds and reservoirs, creation and restoration of river valley and wetlands;</li>
<li>Increase of water retentiveness in the city landscape (mitigation of extreme flows, increase of groundwater level, support of city vegetation) by application of phytotechnology;</li>
<li>Increase of the water quality, ecological stability of freshwater resources and their carrying capacity by instream ecohydrological regulation;</li>
<li>Increase of quality of life and aesthetic values in the catchment by restoration of the river corridor, ecotone zones and landscape;</li>
<li>Increase of human health by incorporating the measures into development plan of the city, based on relationships between the effect of green-lands and water on frequency of allergies and asthma cases.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The changes in the Sokołówka valley raised interest among local developers. One company, investing in a housing area near the river, was interested in contributing to more sustainable storm-water management, and decided to introduce related solutions such as retention wells, in a way that all storm-water can be stored entirely within their investment area. Several bottom-up initiatives focussed on rivers and green spaces emerged in other areas of the city, e.g., the historical area of Księży Młyn and Jasień river. Several NGOs became interested in green and blue infrastructure and the possible use of its services, e.g., alternative sustainable transportation routes (cycle paths) or green backyards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pilot river restoration activities implemented around the Sokołówka River have been a success, and have convinced the Lodz authorities and water professionals of the value of replicating these for other rivers across the city. One of the follow-up projects is Arturówek Reservoirs, which provides an important recreational area for the city inhabitants, visited by up to 3,000 people a day in high season. This area is now a subject of the EU LIFE+ project “Ecohydrologic rehabilitation of recreational reservoirs Arturówek (Łódź) as a model approach to rehabilitation of urban reservoirs”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following on from the Sokołówka river demonstration project, the Blue-Green Network concept was developed by the researchers from the European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology at the Polish Academy of Science in Lodz in 2008. The idea is to frame the development in the city by a network of (restored) river systems and green spaces (agricultural areas, parks and brownfield land). Connecting ‘blue’ and ‘green’ spaces could help to maintain the continuity of ecological processes and provide an integrated approach to storm-water retention and to purification and amelioration of the city microclimate, thus allowing flexible adaptation to climate change and improvements in quality of life and environment in the urban area.</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The close links between the researchers from the University of Lodz and the City of Lodz, in existence since the 1990s, provided a good basis for the collaboration in the SWITCH project. The cooperation was substantially enhanced and widened to include other relevant stakeholders through the establishment of the SWITCH Learning Alliance in Lodz - a stakeholder forum for exchanging ideas, plans and interests, with allocated EU funds for its activities. This process started in March 2006, initially involving the stakeholders perceived to have the most critical roles in water management. Over time, additional important actors were identified and involved. The key stakeholders in the Lodz Learning Alliance at its peak included partners from 25 different organisations, the most important being:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>City of Lodz departments: Municipal Management, Environment and Agriculture, Strategic Planning;</li>
<li>Waterworks and Sewage Company, which operates the treatment plants and water supply and sewerage networks in Lodz;</li>
<li>Lodz Infrastructure Company, which owns the treatment plants and water supply and sewerage networks in Lodz;</li>
<li>Lodz Wastewater Treatment Plant;</li>
<li>Research institutes: (i) Department of Applied Ecology of the University of Lodz, (ii) European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology under the auspices of UNESCO – the International Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences, (iii) Technical University of Lodz, (iv) Medical University of Lodz, (v) Institute of Occupational Medicine in Lodz;</li>
<li>Several NGOs, which joined the Lodz Learning Alliance in 2009 at the Blue-Green Network development launch.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The learning Alliance built and trained a facilitation team, developed a website and communication strategy and hosted several meetings, trainings and workshops on different urban water management issues. Each workshop expanded the membership of the Alliance. The SWITCH team in Lodz undertook a wide range of awareness raising and advocacy activities. These included engaging young people to raise their awareness of environmental issues and to create interest in the city’s hidden rivers. The mass media, especially radio and newspapers, were also engaged. </p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Participation in the SWITCH project was a major driving factor, not least due to the funding available through the project. Participation in the project helped to marry the technical expertise with the planning in the city and raise awareness of the need to consider green and blue spaces in the city. A professor from the University of Lodz stated that “SWITCH has completely changed how the city looks at water (...) The idea that water and green areas can be central in the future of Lodz has become an accepted view in the city”.</li>
<li>Stakeholder involvement through the Learning Alliance was a strong driver of the initiative. Through the alliance, strong new linkages were forged between scientists, decision makers and other key stakeholders. These links are being maintained well beyond the conclusion of the SWITCH project.</li>
<li>A big part of the Learning Alliance success is due to the strong champions within the forum. Committed individuals, in particular a professor from the University of Lodz who has promoted river restoration since the 1990s, have been instrumental to the process of building the partnership and keeping it going. The success of the Learning Alliance also relied upon strong facilitation, frequent communication, and the commitment of stakeholders from all organisations to regular involvement. Although the Learning Alliance is no longer operating officially, the links established still bring benefits, in the form of new projects, initiatives and better cooperation among the Learning Alliance former members.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Discontinuation of funding after completion of the SWITCH project is a major limiting factor, which means replicating  the demonstration project will be difficult.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The EU funding was vital to the project. The total SWITCH project budget for activities in Lodz of about €1,150,000 covered the costs to the university and to the City of Lodz for five years. The Sokołówka River demonstration project had a budget of approximately € 700,000. About € 130,000 was invested in the Learning Alliance activities. It should be mentioned that many in-kind contributions were made, in particular by the researchers and PhD students from the research institutions in Lodz.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Benefits have not been quantified so far, but need to be computed taking into account avoided damages from flooding in the urban area, increased quality of the urban environment, improvements of air quality and reduction of the urban heat island effect.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In May 2009, the recommendations for a Blue-Green Network were incorporated into one of the most important strategic city’s documents used as a basis for spatial planning: the Study of Conditions and Directions of Spatial Development of the City of Lodz. In 2012, the concept became officially part of the Strategy for Integrated Development of Lodz 2020+. The follow up Arturowek Reservoirs project directly responds to the requirements of the EU Directive 2006/7/WE on bathing waters and Water Framework Directive 2000/60/UE.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[The refurbishment of Gomeznarro park in Madrid focused on storm water retention]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of its topography and impermeable ground surface, the Gomeznarro Park in Madrid was affected by erosion during heavy rainfall events, and the surrounding residential areas suffered from flash flooding. In response to these problems, in 2003 complex works aiming at improving the natural drainage and rain water retention were carried out in the park. These included removal of impervious pavement and use of permeable surfaces, restoration of compacted soils, revegetation of the areas at risk of erosion and installation of underground rainwater collection system and storage tanks.  These measures eliminated the problem of erosion and flash flooding in the area, reduced pressure on wastewater management system and established a more natural water cycle in the area. An additional benefit came from the increased moisture in the soil that also helps to ameliorate the Urban Heat Island effect in and around the park.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[permeable surface, sustainable urban drainage systems, urban park, green space, groundwater recharge, Madrid]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The park is characterised by steep slopes. This, in combination with compacted soils and considerable proportion of sealed surfaces in the park resulted in little infiltration of water into the ground, and intense water runoff and erosion during heavy rain events. The housing nearby was regularly affected by flooding, and the basements and ground floors were suffering from dampness, causing inconvenience and health hazard to local residents. In addition, the runoff carried a considerable amount of suspended matter that was a burden for the waste water management system in the city. Low rates of infiltration implied low moisture levels in the soil. As a consequence, the park area had difficulties in supporting substantial vegetation and thus was not providing as much cooling as possible during hot weather. The state of the park area had already caused problems for residents in terms of flooded buildings as a result of cloud bursts; leading to protests by inhabitants were the driver for including the improvement of the park’s drainage system in a programme of urban rehabilitation. Although not explicitly addressing increasing risks of cloud bursts and droughts under changing climate conditions, the solution adopted will contribute to improving the resilience of the residential area to heavy rainfall events and drought. In addition, increased infiltration capacity and the increased water availability for the park vegetation, as well as reduced surface run-off, will improve the microclimate, especially important during heat spells.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim of this initiative was to restore the natural water cycle in the urbanised area of Gomeznarro Park. The specific objectives were:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Regeneration of the park landscape;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Elimination or significant reduction of runoff processes;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Reduction of the volume of water with high levels of suspended matter, whose quantity and quality affected the urban drainage system during heavy rain events;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Demonstration of the efficiency of new water sensitive materials and rainwater management techniques.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The 10,000 square meters area of the Gomeznarro Park located in the southern part of Madrid, in Hortaleza District, underwent a transformation through application of a combination of grey and green infrastructure. The changes in the park included:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li style="text-align: justify;">Restructuring and/or replacement of the eroded and compacted soil;</li>
<li>Removal of impervious pavements and their replacement with permeable surfaces, thereby facilitating water drainage and collection;</li>
<li>Installation of underground storage tanks under the pavements and the associated water collection and distribution system;</li>
<li>Re-vegetation of the eroded areas.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2004, the project received a ‘good practice’ qualification as part of the best practice award scheme by the UN Habitat. The water infiltration and collection technology has been subsequently replicated in a number of projects in Madrid (e.g. green areas in Valdebebas development; Madrid Rio - M-30 motorway; sports areas Daoiz y Velarde and Marques de Samaranch; Alzheimer Centre Fundación Reina Sofia) and elsewhere in Spain (e.g. the shopping centre car-park in Autonomous Community of Galicia and  a park in Urbanización Torré Baró in Barcelona).</p>
]]></field_solutions>
    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was driven and funded by the Madrid municipality. The technology and consultancy for the intervention was provided by a private consultancy company. The park is surrounded by social housing built in the 1960s. Tenants’ complaints about the dampness in their houses caused by flash flooding provided an impulse for the housing association to refurbish the residential buildings. This process was integrated with the municipality’s plan and the revitalisation of the Gomeznarro Park.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology and materials applied were novel in Spain. This caused delays in implementation, as the design had to be carefully planned; approval criteria for the solutions proposed by the private consultant and provider of the technology had to be defined; and the contractors had to be thoroughly briefed. A particular difficulty arose as a result of the need to engage different municipal departments (water management, construction, planning, environment and others) in the planning and delivery. The  drainage of urban green spaces approach adopted in this case study has been replicated in other locations in Madrid and elsewhere in Spain.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The municipality of Madrid financed the project. The construction cost was €343,600 (approximately € 34/m2). Whilst the benefits have not been assessed in monetary terms, there are no additional maintenance costs in comparison to traditional landscaping solutions used in parks. The project resulted in reduced erosion, risk of flooding and pressure on the drainage systems. The park receives yearly about 5 million litres of rain water, which now does not enter the drainage system but instead recharges the groundwater levels and results in a lower need for additional watering by park maintenance. Further benefits include improved air quality and reduced air temperatures in and around the park.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2002, the Municipality of Madrid introduced compulsory environmental impacts assessment for any urban transformation undertaken in the city (Ley 2/2002, De 19 de Junio, de Evaluación Ambiental de la Comunidad De Madrid), including the reduction of water consumption as one of the assessment criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the completion of the project, a municipal by-law for efficient use of water was introduced (Ordenanza de Gestión y Uso Eficiente del Agua en la Ciudad de Madrid ANM 2006\50) which explicitly requires measures for reduction of water consumption and creation of water reserves in Madrid.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Lower Danube green corridor: floodplain restoration for flood protection]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2000, the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova pledged to work together – with the signing of the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement - to establish a green corridor along the entire length of the Lower Danube River (~1,000 km). All partners recognized a need and shared responsibility to protect and manage the Lower Danube in a sustainable way. The Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement aims to protect and restore wetlands along the river and reconnect the river to its natural flooding areas, reducing the risks of major flooding in areas with human settlements and offering benefits both for local economies – e.g. through fisheries, tourism – and for the ecosystems along the river. To achieve this, sections of dikes have been removed and isolated river meanders have been reconnected to the river.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years (e.g. 2005 and 2006), severe floods occurred along the Lower Danube River. Even more frequent flooding is anticipated with climate change. A large part – about 80% - of Danube's wetlands have been lost in the past century because of human intervention. The construction of dikes reduced the size of the river’s floodplains considerably. In addition, large parts of the Danube are experiencing river bed erosion due to gravel extraction, dredging and dams, contributing to a lowering of water tables on adjacent agricultural lands.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall objective of the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement is to:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Protect 1 million ha of existing and new protected areas;</li>
<li>Restore 224,000 ha of natural floodplain;</li>
<li>Promote sustainable use and development along the final 1,000 km of the Danube, including the Danube Delta.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The restoration of floodplains is meant to provide room to retain and safely release flood waters.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement it was agreed by the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and Ukraine to restore 2,236 km2 of floodplain to form a 9,000 km2 Lower Danube Green Corridor. Cut-off from the river by dykes, these floodplain lands were of marginal value for primary industries. Once restored, these lands will be of similar scale as the area inundated in the 2005 and 2006 floods. As of 2012, 600 km2 of floodplain has been restored or is undergoing restoration; and enhancing flood protection and local peoples livelihoods through the strengthening of ecosystem services and nature conservation. Most flood plain restorations have been achieved by removing sections of dykes. During the 2013 flood in the Danube along the lower Danube there was no flooding, although the water level was above average. The flood peak decreased downstream of the Iron Gates dam, which was also due to the dam’s operations.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of CCA aspects.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">WWF has taken responsibility for the Lower Danube Green Corridor initiative as part of the WWF Living Planet Programme which is aimed to secure the conservation of the world’s most important biological resources and ecosystems into the next millennium. WWF is a global conservation organisation which aims to stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. In the Lower Danube Green Corridor project, WWF works closely with the governments of the countries - Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and Ukraine - that signed the Agreement, as well as local stakeholders. To achieve the objectives, each country prepared an action plan in which additional areas of floodplain were designated for protection and restoration. These action plans described for each designated area what specific measures were needed and what steps had to be taken to carry out these measures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">All stakeholders supported a regular exchange of information - through meetings and by establishing contact points at the Ministries of Environment in the four participating countries - in order to achieve effective protection of the Lower Danube Green Corridor. WWF played a facilitator role to increase communication and cooperation between the Lower Danube Green Corridor countries and supported implementation of concrete restoration projects, like models to be scaled up. Recent political changes, however, resulted in the termination of the contact points, hence currently WWF has substantial difficulty in communicating with the Ministries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Both citizens and environmental NGOs were offered the opportunity to play an active role in decision making processes. WWF has conducted awareness raising campaigns and also directly engaged the general public and NGOs in the decision making process in the project area. Active lobbying has been done at national and international levels to boost implementation of the Lower Danube Green Corridor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Furthermore, partners were sought locally and nationally as well as internationally, i.e. GEF, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank, EU, WWF, IUCN, Ramsar Convention and Governments (i.e. Austria, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands), to solicit their co-operation and assistance in the creation and maintenance of a Lower Danube Green Corridor. The main funding sources came from WWF, national governments, EU and the corporate sector. The International Commission for the Protection of Danube River strongly supported the implementation of the Lower Danube Green Corridor, the 10 years anniversary of Lower Danube Green Corridor being celebrated on the occasion of the endorsement of the Danube River Basin Management Plan by Danube countries governments. The first assessment of the potential for restoration of the Lower Danube Floodplain was funded by UNDP and set the basis for the Lower Danube Green Corridor agreement.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">International agreements for better water and river management have been a powerful tool for change in the Danube River Basin. Restoring the natural resilience of the environment to climate events (in this case large-scale adaptation) by decommissioning under-performing water infrastructure and thereby improving the natural capacity to retain and release peak floods, brings additional benefits both for nature and people. New opportunities for eco-tourism, fishing, grazing and fibre production strengthen local economies, and the resulting higher quality habitat attracts wider range of species, including endangered ones. Once the land ownership issues were settled and local communities were aware of the project, the works could start.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The Lower Danube Green Corridor agreement served as an excellent basis to translate governmental decisions into actions. In countries like Romania and Bulgaria, the implementation of the Natura 2000 network significantly contributed to increasing the area under protection. Also, the harmonisation of the environmental legislation with the EU requirements, especially the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, opened new opportunities to restore lateral connectivity. In other cases, the need of the local communities to have access to enhanced natural resources was the main driver. Change of land ownership after the land restitution reforms in the Lower Danube Green Corridor countries make restoration projects challenging.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Proper attention to the issue of land ownership was the key for success in the project. In each restoration project a few to a dozen land owners - depending on the size of the restoration area - had to be convinced that a change in land use would be beneficial for them. In case of private land owners it was important to ensure them that they don't lose the property rights. WWF started two pilot projects in Romania, where local communities and individuals gave their land to be flooded. The trigger to accept such rigorous change in land use was the understanding of the benefits deriving from changing the unproductive arable land into wetlands. The implementation of the restoration projects would likely be accelerated if compensatory schemes for land owners are in place, however, this is not the case in any of the participating countries. That is why WWF is currently lobbying for EU funding of floodplain restoration and the development of green infrastructure along the Lower Danube.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Another success factor was that an independent organisation with know-how - in this case WWF - took the lead and kept putting effort in bringing the countries together, providing technical and financial support for meetings and background documents, encouraging governments to stay committed, etc. The most convincing argument for signing the agreement was the need to have a holistic approach in nature conservation and environmental protection for the Lower Danube. Certainly, the availability of financial resources has been important, but in the end the political will in each country is believed to be the decisive factor to actually move to implementation on a larger scale. </p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Floodplain restoration along the Lower Danube Green Corridor has been estimated to cost 183 million euro. Economic benefits are through:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The avoidance of damages due to floods (e.g. the 2005 flood resulted in 396 million euro in damages);</li>
<li>Expected earnings of 85.6 million euro through ecosystem services (e.g. fisheries, tourism) per year. Each hectare of restored floodplain is estimated to provide 500 euro per year in ecosystem services, helping to diversify the livelihoods of local people.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The Lower Danube Green Corridor reduces the risks of major flooding in areas with human settlements and offering benefits both for local economies – e.g. fisheries, tourism – and for the ecosystems along the river.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Amphibious housing in Maasbommel, the Netherlands]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Netherlands is a country with a long history of mitigating flood damage and adapting to flood risk. With 60% of the country below sea level, the development and implementation of flood resilient infrastructure has become an important part of the Dutch culture. The flood threat in the Netherlands is not only related to rising sea-levels. Rivers also pose a risk of flooding. This risk is increased by climate change as it causes more frequent and extreme rainfall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The program “Ruimte voor de Rivier” (room for the river), implemented in 1997, included the development of natural flood areas, where water could be temporarily stored in case of rising water levels. This had large consequences for the urban development of these areas as development of permanent construction was no longer allowed. One of these locations, Maasbommel (on the Maas river), became the site where the first amphibious houses were realized in 2005 (specifically 32 real amphibious houses plus 14 floating house were realised). Although the technology of amphibious houses proved itself during a flood in 2011, the concept is only moderately adopted in the Netherlands. In 2012 the total number of “water houses”, which is the definition under which amphibious houses fall, was estimated at a several hundred in the Netherlands. In the case of Maasbommel, both the adequate technology and an interested developer were available. However, the difficulty proved to be to obtain building permission due to unfamiliarity with the concept in regulation and hesitance to build in areas that were considered dangerous. Another important difficulty is that unconventional way of building leads to higher construction costs combined with a limited market of possible owners.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The case of Maasbommel, located along the Maas river, addresses the challenge of building in a flood zone in order to adapt to an increasing risk of river flooding. The rivers Maas and Waal are expected to flood once every 12 years; this risk is increased by climate change. After the 1993 and 1995 floods, selected sites near the rivers were appointed as flood zones, according to the “Room for the river” programme, in which construction was restricted. Land is valuable in the Netherlands, which motivated the developer Dura Vermeer and the architecture and engineering companies (Factor Architecten and Boiten raadgevende ingenieurs) to propose the development of amphibious houses in the flood zones.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the Maasbommel project was to test and demonstrate in a real environment the amphibious house concept, as a concrete (current and future) adaptation solution to allow urban settlement and development in flood zones, thus preserving at the same time both the water storage capacity and the economic value of the area. This project demonstrates a transformative approach to adaptation in comparison with the conventional flood resilient infrastructure.</p>

    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To obtain the permit for the development of the amphibious houses, a design meeting several requirements was elaborated. The houses needed to be able to float up vertically to 5,5 meters. With regard to safety, a house should have an escape route. This means in the case of the amphibious houses that the bridge providing access to the house is not sufficient itself. An escape route also needs to be provided when the house is in floating position. In addition, it needs to meet the standard requirements for load combinations of the main construction and fire safety. Houses built in the floodplains also need to comply with the National Water Act. To meet the safety requirements, a weir needs to be integrated in any construction within the floodplains. The way in which these requirements are met affect the category in which the house is defined, which in turn affect the rights of the future residents and the market price of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking into account the demands of the government, design consisting of a concrete base with a wooden skeleton construction on top was developed. Wood is used to support the floating capacity of the construction as it ensures that the total construction remains as light-weight as possible. The foundation of the house consists of a large, hollow concrete cube, which is “moored” on huge steel pipes to keep the house in place while enabling it to move vertically in case of rising water levels. Residents can feel a very small up and down movement while being in the house, even when it is not in a floating position. This construction method means that amphibious houses have a fixed location as they are constantly connected to the soil through their foundation. The houses differ in this respect from the traditional house-boats, which are based on a fully floating construction that is similar to a boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent the houses from dislodging in the mud, there is a need for some room between the foundation and the soil. Connections to water, gas, electricity and other supplies also need to be flexible as the complete house needs to be able to float. Therefore these connections are brought into the house through flexible piping that is able to move depending on the water level. This ensures that utilities can keep functioning in case of high water. An escape route is ensured through a boat to enable residents to reach the shore in case the house is in its elevated position.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides the developer and the designers, other stakeholders involved in the project are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Rijkswaterstaat, the agency of the Dutch Ministry of Environment charged with the practical execution of public and waterworks. They are responsible for the management of the flood zones. They were among the promoter of the intervention and were specifically included in the process to ensure that safety requirements for construction in a flood zone are met. Despite some initial hesitation of the national authority Rijkswaterstaat, the rules were eventually adapted so that building permissions could be obtained. In 2005 the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment announced they would accept proposals for amphibious and other flood-resilient structures in 15 flood-prone areas (the so called EMAB locations).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Municipality of West, Maas and Waal, which is the local governmental body authorized to draft zoning plans, supply building permits and building codes and grant permission for land allocation. They assess compliance to all applicable legislation for which means they are charged with making interpretations of how the national requirements translate to the local situation. This compliance determines the approval of the building permit.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The residents of the amphibious houses, who responded very positive to their new residences. The first residents indicated that living in an amphibious house is a conscious choice for more adventurous living in the middle of nature. They specifically chose the houses for their ability to resist floods.</li>
</ul>]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main identified success factors are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The first genuine test of the concept came in 2011, when the water of the river Maas increased to a level that caused the amphibious houses to float for the first time. Also in floating condition there were no problems detected. The residents have stated that they are very satisfied with their houses.</li>
<li>Since their realization the amphibious houses in Maasbommel have received a lot of attention in the international press. In September 2010 the Maasbommel project was awarded with the Water Wonen &#38; Ruimte Award (Water Living &#38; Space Award) for its iconic contribution to architecture that set an example for future developments. Maasbommel also served as an example in a Dutch government campaign on building experiments adapting to flood risk.</li>
<li>Dura Vermeer, Factor Factor Architecten and Boiten have been involved in spin-off projects. Together they realized a project of two floating and 4 amphibious houses in the village Ohé en Laak in the Netherlands. Factor Architecten also developed a design for the construction of amphibious houses in the flood zones of Lac de Raby in France.</li>
<li>The concept also offers potential for the integration of mitigation measures. An example is the development of six emission-free amphibious houses in IJburg, which were designed by architecture agency Art Zaaijer. These houses have the ability to turn direction, which makes them especially suitable for solar energy generation.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Although the pilot in Maasbommel has been successful, the further expansion of the concept has been limited to a few locations. This slow uptake is in contrast to the prediction made that floating houses will play an important role in compensating the shortfall of land of 40% in the next 40 years. More confidence in the floating housing market can stimulate further developments, which could be supported through appropriate regulation. The confidence of potential future residents also depends on the costs of floating or amphibious housing in comparison to traditional housing, the insurance possibilities and the housing typology for which a permit can be obtained. In the case of Maasbommel, the houses were assigned a recreational status due to the designation of the area as a recreational zone in the local zoning plan. This poses restrictions on the usage of the houses, for example residents are only allowed to live in the house part of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another limitation is the willingness of future residents to live in an amphibious house. A study by the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands showed that mostly highly educated people already living in a detached house were interested in amphibious living. The crisis on the Dutch housing market in 2008 potentially even further reduced this group of potential buyers and decreased the confidence among investors in the floating housing market. This has limited the further development of the concept.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The amphibious houses in Maasbommel are considered expensive for Dutch standards. They were the first realized amphibious houses in the Netherlands and therefore all the (pre-fab) construction elements needed to be specifically made for the project. This led to higher construction costs. The houses were sold for around 320.000 euros at the time. Although the houses are quite large with an average floor area of 120 square meters, this is considered a high price for a recreational house (i.e. families cannot live there all year). Especially since the price of the average residential house in 2005 was around 222.000 euros in the Netherlands. In addition, there was a higher risk involved due to new technology being applied. This concern was mitigated by Dura Vermeer by offering a 15 year guarantee for the floating ability of each house. A larger adoption of the technique would allow construction for this type of house to become cheaper and increase commercial interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the high construction cost, the concept is still of interest to developers as it enables them to use water as a “building ground” which then reduces the site preparation costs. Building ground is very valuable in densely populated areas such as the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, site preparation costs are usually quite high because the soil is not suitable to be built on directly as it does not have any carrying capacity. Direct construction will cause the houses to sink into the ground over the course of time, which will ultimately cause damages to the house. Therefore it is a standard procedure to prepare the site through reinforcements, which are quite expensive and drive-up the price of the house. In case water is used as building ground, the construction floats and is therefore less dependent on the carrying capacity of the soil. Additionally, the pre-fab elements of the house can be constructed off-site, which means that the houses can be realized with less nuisance for nearby residents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building on water could have the potential to provide an interesting alternative for the construction industry, but until now the costs of floating and amphibious houses have proved to be higher compared to the construction of a traditional house. Standardization of building elements and design tools has the potential to reduce the costs in case of a larger adoption of the concept. Also the type of costs taken into account affect the final amount. For example, the costs for making the construction of floating or amphibious houses flood resilient are included in the construction. In case of traditional housing, the costs of flood resilient infrastructure are paid by the community through the taxes raised by the Water Boards. The impact and quantity of these costs is hard to assess at this moment as only around 10 projects have been realized in the Netherlands. It will require the realization of more projects to make a representative comparison between the costs of traditional, floating and amphibious housing.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the stakeholders who are involved in the floating houses development process are enthusiastic about the concept, the planning process for the development of new initiatives is still difficult. Three main aspects that hinder the development process can be identified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first is the continuous insecurity on the interpretation of regulations by the municipality and Rijkswaterstaat, which can cause serious delays in the building process. This could be mitigated through the development of guidelines for the local government on the interpretation and implementation of the national legislation in relation to the local situation. Another reason for slow adoption of the concept is the lack of faith in the floating housing market by developers. In the case of Maasbommel, the project obtained permission for realization through an experimental policy program of the Dutch Ministry. This program has currently ended. Therefore a new project would need to meet the requirements of Rijkswaterstaat. This means that the developer is financially responsible for the realization of additional measures to compensate for any hindrance of the water flow that the houses might cause. Clear and consistent legislation could help to create a stable market for these types of developments. Finally, existing land use plans can also pose a barrier to the more frequent adoption of the floating housing concept and should therefore include floating housing concepts more frequently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the floating and amphibious housing flared up a debate on their legal status as either a house of a boat. The status of a house is defined by the typology assigned to a location in the local zoning plan. In the case of Maasbommel, the amphibious houses have therefore officially received the status of a recreational home. The duties and rights of the residents depend on the legal definition of the house and whether it complies with the Dutch Housing Act. The definition can for example affect the possibilities for future residents to apply for housing related subsidies. In 2014, the Dutch Council of State ruled that the definition of a floating or amphibious house as a construction should be dependent on their future use rather than their manner of construction. This means that the houses have to apply for a building permit and comply with regulation in the Dutch Housing Act and the National Building Code. This leads to further complications as current regulation and building codes are not supportive of floating housing requirements. To address these issues, the Ministry of Housing and Civil Service announced in June 2015 that they are preparing a new proposal for legislation.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Addressing coastal erosion in Marche region, Italy]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A series of actions were taken to address erosion in the section of coast between the municipalities of Sirolo and Numana, in the region of Le Marche (Italy), in particular for beach nourishment, principally with gravel and small stones. Cliff stabilisation was another part of the actions, as well as the removal of a portion of artificial reef. The approach for this work was established in the region’s Integrated Coastal Area Managed Plan (released in February 2005). Its broader goals included protecting local settlements and tourism. Climate change impacts were recognised but were not a major element of the actions undertaken so far; however, the region intends to make climate change a key focus for future works.</p>

    <field_sectors><![CDATA[Coastal areas]]></field_sectors>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The actions undertaken so far have sought to restore the coastline, which has retreated due to erosion, and to strengthen the coastline against the risk of storms and flooding, in particular related to storm surges, which have been a major concern in recent years. Works also seek to reduce the risks of landslides along coastal cliffs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The actions in this case study were undertaken in two municipalities. Here, three main types of shoreline are found: a beach in front of cliff; a cliff face on the water line; and a relatively broad coastal beach, however with few dunes in the backshore, which rises towards hills. In the municipality of Sirolo, where the first two types of shoreline are found, the erosion of San Michele beach has been accompanied by afforestation which reduced the beach area and the cut off sediment. In addition, waves hitting the base of the sea-cliff of Mount Conero risk creating landslides which could endanger part of the town. In the municipality of Numana, erosion has reduced the width of a relatively long and broad beachfront, bringing a coastal road closer to the shoreline. This area extends to the Musone River; works on this river have reduced the transport of sediment to the shoreline, increasing erosion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To an important extent, the challenges addressed arose due to previous human interventions. For example, modifications of rivers in the region, including the Musone River, at the south of the beach area in Numana, have reduced their transport of sediment to the sea and to the beaches. Another example is work to place large blocks at the base of the sea cliff of Mount Conero: while the intention was to protect the cliff, it appears that these accentuate wave energy. The work has helped to adapt against the impacts of climate change. Beach nourishment will need to be continued in the near future, with the goal also of addressing sea-level rise (actions to address sea-level rise of about 25 cm for 2050 and 60 cm for 2100 are being considered in planning).</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objectives are to protect beach areas (in particular, lower sections of the beach), as well as cliffs, against erosion. In doing so, these actions seek to protect settlements and the tourism-based economy of this coastal area. Moreover, the overall strategic approach set out in the region’s Integrated Coastal Area Managed (ICAM) Plan is to focus on actions that address the imbalance between sediment erosion and accretion along the coast and to reduce the environmental and landscape impacts of coastal defences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this objective focused on protection, the work also sought to strengthen the recreational opportunities of the shoreline (and hence tourism) and improve nature protection.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the municipality of Sirolo, about 156,000 mc of gravel was used for beach nourishment along a 1200 m shoreline in the San Michele Bay. In the municipality of Numana, about 172,000 mc of gravel were used along 1500 m of beach front. The work also included actions to stabilise a cliff base for Mount Cornero. This mountain is designated as a Natura 2000 site, and the works incorporated the need to maintain site conditions. In the long term, several actions involving retreat from the shoreline are under consideration, including: relocation of shoreline tourism installations and coastal infrastructure and settlements. Other long-term actions under consideration include the maintenance of rivers in order to increase their transport of sediment and thus provide natural beach nourishment, the removal of fixed coastal defences (grey infrastructure) and the protection of a sufficiently wide coastal strip. As of late 2014, however, budget resources had not been allocated for follow-up.</p>

    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The regional administration of Le Marche provided information to local citizens via flyers and newsletters. Moreover, interviews were held with tourism operators in the two municipalities, along with meetings with key stakeholders including the fishing and tourism sectors. The regional administration emphasised three objectives of the work: strengthening protection against storms and other risks, improving recreational opportunities and strengthening nature protection.</p>

    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main success factors include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Use of cost/benefit analysis (and EIA) to strengthen project planning;</li>
<li>Strong public information, stakeholder consultation and cooperation with local communities.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Main limiting factors are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Beach nourishment will have to be repeated due to ongoing erosion (proposed works to re-establish river sediment transport could reduce future erosion);</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Budget uncertainties for follow-up work due to economic crisis.</li>
</ul>]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of the works in Sirolo and Numana was 8.6 million Euros. These costs were partially financed by Italy’s national Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea and by the Central Institute for Scientific and Technological Research Applied to the Sea (ICRAM, now part of ISPRA, the national Institute for Environmental Protection and Research). The benefits include strengthened protection against storm surge and other risks, as well as benefits for local tourism and thus the local economy. In 2013, following completion of the project, the work at Sirolo and Numana were included in a cost-benefit analysis prepared under the EU Shape-IPA project; the analysis, focused, mainly on tourism revenue as a benefit.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The works were based on the objectives and approaches set out in the Marche region’s 2005 Integrated Coastal Area Managed Plan. A formal agreement with the national Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea and ICRAM was a necessary step for financing. An EIA and appropriate assessment were made for the project, incorporating public consultation.</p>
]]></field_legal>
    <field_implementation><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The actual work took two years, from April 2009 to April 2011. Preceding activities included the agreement on financing with the national Ministry of Environment and ICRAM, in December 2007, and project preparation.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Building railway transport resilience to Alpine hazards in Austria]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The railway transportation system of the Alpine country Austria plays an important role in the European transit of passengers and freights. Moreover, the Austrian railway network is essential for the accessibility of lateral alpine valleys and is thus of crucial importance for their economic and societal welfare. If traffic networks are (temporarily) disrupted, alternative options for transportation are rarely available. Due to the Alpine topography and the limited space available, railway lines often follow floodplains and are located along steep and unsteady slopes. This considerably exposes them to flooding and in particular to alpine hazards, such as debris flows, rock falls, avalanches or landslides. These events can cause substantial damage to railway infrastructure, pose a risk to the safety of passengers and are thus a great issue of concern for the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB Infra AG). In the future, the risk from Alpine hazards could increase considerably due to climate change. To address current and future risks from climate related hazards, the ÖBB Infra AG employs a combination of structural protection measures and a railway-specific weather monitoring and early warning system.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Continental]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The harsh mountainous nature of the Eastern Alps, in which around 65% of the national territory of Austria is situated, poses a particular challenge to railway transport planning and management. Relief and steep slopes limit the space usable for permanent settlements and infrastructure. Hence, railway lines often follow floodplains or are located along steep unsteady slopes, which considerably exposes them to flooding and in particular to alpine hazards, e.g. debris flows, rock falls, avalanches or landslides. As a result, railway infrastructure and operation has been repeatedly impacted by alpine hazards. For instance, several coaches of an intercity train derailed at the Masonbach torrent (Vorarlberg) on 11<sup>th</sup> August 1995, following a debris flow event that had destroyed a bridge. Three people were killed, 17 people were heavily injured and the track had to be closed for almost one week. Also in June 2013, floods and debris flow events caused substantial damage to the railway infrastructure. The national railway operator ÖBB Infra AG reported losses of about €75 million to its railway network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of alpine hazards are triggered by extreme/severe (hydro-) meteorological conditions such as heavy precipitation, rapid snow melt or extreme temperatures. In the future, the risk from Alpine hazards could significantly increase due to the impact of climate change. For instance, the number of very intense rainfall events could increase by 36% in the Alpine areas and 70% in the lowlands of the country (between the reference period 1961–1990 and the projection period 2011–2040; <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/4/2/25">Kellermann <em>et al</em>. 2016</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB Infra AG), along with partners from civil society, the private sector and the government, are left with the challenging mandate to assess risks, take preventive measures, and ensure the safe and continuous operation of the network. One risk reduction strategy followed is the implementation of structural protection measures, such as dikes and embankments. In this respect, prioritization of measures and issues of cost-sharing with other governmental stakeholders is a challenge. At the same time, the implementation of structural measures against alpine hazards in Austria – with its approximately 5,000 torrents and 3,800 avalanche paths – is often not feasible for both economic reasons and aspects of nature and landscape protection. Since technical measures are thus limited in ensuring a commensurate level of safety for railway operations in the alpine topography, there is a strong need for additional (non-structural) risk reduction measures, such as weather monitoring and early warning.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Meteorological extreme events pose a great risk for railway infrastructure and the safety of passengers. In the future, climate change will presumably have serious implications on meteorological hazards in the Alpine region. To minimize direct damage to railway infrastructure, structural protections measures are implemented by the ÖBB Infra AG along with its partners where this is economically, technically and environmentally feasible. However, especially in the alpine environment full protection is not possible and the risk profile continuously changes due to climate change. To ensure the safe and continuous operation of the network and the safety of passengers, a complementary weather monitoring and early warning systems was installed.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ÖBB Infra AG follows mainly two complementary risk management strategies. On the one hand, risk from Alpine hazards is reduced by implementing structural protection measures. ÖBB Infra AG is mainly responsible itself for constructing and maintaining protective measures, such as dikes or debris sheds. In most cases, it also needs to finance these measures. Nevertheless, if the planned measures protect also settlements or other infrastructure elements such as roads or energy supply, cooperation with other state and regional authorities or communities takes place and the protection system can be subsidized within the Hydraulic Engineering Assistance Act (WBFG [1985] 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, risk from Alpine hazards is reduced by improving preparedness for response and emergency management. A key element of ÖBB’s risk reduction strategy is the weather monitoring and early warning system called infra:wetter, which is jointly operated by ÖBB and the private weather service UBIMET GmbH. This interactive web-portal available to the ÖBB staff combines data from own and external weather stations of the ZAMG (Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik - Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics), radars, satellites as well as local and global weather projections with detailed information on the complete railway network in Austria. It provides a calculation of important meteorological parameters like temperature, wind speed, precipitation, snowfall, and the snow line at a local level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides providing individualized and route-specific warnings to approximately 1,500 users, infra:wetter is also used to identify so-called critical meteorological conditions (CMCs) in advance: weather conditions that potentially lead to larger disruptions of train traffic and thus require coordinated action by the Natural Hazards Management Department of the ÖBB Infra AG. In case a critical meteorological condition is detected with sufficient pre-warning time, a weather warning is issued and a plan of procedures is implemented. This can include the installation of an incidence command that decides about operational safety precautions, such as speed limits, track closures or temporary mitigation measures. For instance, in the case that heavy snowfall is predicted, measures such as a revised planning of human resources and provision of winter services, or preheating of switch points can be undertaken to ensure the operability of the network. The existence of a functioning weather monitoring and early warning system is also an effective and flexible risk management solution to address the projected changes in the frequency and intensity of climatic hazards due to climate change.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To address the risk posed by natural hazards, ÖBB Infra AG provides relevant resources for natural hazard management and is approved to take its own decisions as a company. However, due to the complex situation of alpine hazards, their management within the railway transportation in Austria cannot be handled by ÖBB Infra AG alone, and structural risk mitigation measures in the transport sector have to be aligned with public risk management strategies in many places. Thus, partnerships and vital cooperation between various stakeholders at different administrative levels, i.e. from the local level to the national level, are needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At a superordinate level, ÖBB Infra AG cooperates with federal ministries on strategic issues such as decisions in legislation and technical standards. At the level of structural risk reduction measures, ÖBB Infra AG cooperates with regional authorities, communities and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BMLFUW). Regarding non-structural measures, ÖBB Infra AG cooperates with the private sector, academic institutions and regional authorities for operating the weather monitoring and early warning system and to improve risk assessments.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Operation of the Austrian Heat Protection Plan]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p class="Standard1" style="line-height: 14pt; margin: 6pt 0cm; text-align: justify;">Evidence that increasing temperatures leads to increased mortality and morbidity is well documented, with population vulnerability being location specific. Especially the 2003 heat wave in Europe raised the awareness of negative impacts of heat stress on human health in Austria. Increased incidence of heat waves leads to an increase in heat stress, especially in urban areas; the intensification of the heat-island effect is to be expected. Following the 2003 heat wave, different Austrian provinces like Styria (2011) and Carinthia (2013) developed heat protection plans, based on recommendations from the World Health Organisation, which recommended to develop strategies, plans and packages of measures in order to protect citizens from heat stress. These plans provide an information basis for public health services. Based on the experience from the two provinces, an Austrian heat protection plan, led by the Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs with involvement of several relevant actors on the national and provincial level was prepared and put in action in 2017. The plan sets out the connection between climate change and health as well as the meteorological baseline information for heat warnings, which is provided by the National Met Service (ZAMG). The information and warnings are directed to the citizen via a sound network of institutions and actors in the health field.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Heat waves occur in recurrent intervals in Austria. Due to climate change, more prolonged and more frequent heat waves are to be expected. Heat waves are defined by persistent daytime and night-time temperatures that exceed certain limits, negatively affecting the health of individuals and at-risk groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New record high temperatures in low-lying areas of Austria have been measured in the recent decades. There is an increase in night-time minimum temperatures of over 20°C, particularly during hot spells. This leads to an increase in thermo-physical burden on hot days and during heat waves as well as an increase in the mortality rate during heat waves, especially for high-risk groups (e.g. elderly, children, and chronically ill people). Also possible performance impairment on hot days and during heat waves are given.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the Austrian Heat Protection Plan is to reduce heat stress and prevent additional climate change-related negative health effects in the population in especially heat-prone areas (e.g., urban areas affected by the heat-island effect). In addition to climate change, broad demographic changes in Austrian society are to be expected. Changes in population size, age distribution, number of single-person households, or other demographic characteristics have implications on the handling of the environment, but also on specific needs (e.g., heat sensitivity increases with age). The plan serves to increase awareness of the health-related problems caused by prolonged heat waves. Practical tips and a guide for authorities and institutions should help to prevent heat-induced illnesses and fatal casualties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Special attention is placed on the chronically ill people, people in poor health condition, children, the elderly and people living in areas increasingly subject to heat waves. This plan establishes roles and functions for governmental institutions at national and regional (Bundesland) level. Although it is coordinated centrally by the Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs, it has a de-centralized operational structure.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main elements and actions foreseen by the plan include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Definition of roles and responsibilities for each authority involved in the plan operation. Within the health sector, roles and responsibilities involve national and regional levels. The Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs informs about the heat warning on its web-page and provides and promotes precautionary measures for the citizens. The provinces provide as early as possible specific information to different targets (e.g. homes for the elderly, nursing homes, hospitals, kindergartens).</li>
<li>Daily alerts to the general public are provided by the National Met Service (ZAMG) regarding the state of hazard related to extreme temperature and heat waves. Four possible alert levels are considered: (i) Green, indicating normal temperatures for that time of year; (ii) Yellow, indicating that temperatures are higher and there is potential to cause adverse health effects in the most sensitive population; (iii) Orange, indicating that temperatures are high and it is likely to cause adverse health effects in the sensitive population; (vi) Red, indicating extremely high temperatures likely to cause significant adverse health effects.</li>
<li>For each alert level specific protection measures are established to reduce possible adverse health impacts; for example, during an orange and red alert level the following measures can be activated: (a) Inform the general population, health establishments, social services, and relevant media channels of the alert level and recommend what protective measures (i.e. drinking of water) can be applied to reduce heat-stress; information material is being provided by the Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs and the regions as well as in relevant facilities (e.g. homes for the elderly, nursing homes, hospitals, kindergartens); (b) Enhance communication channels in an early phase (adequate lead time) between the health sector and other sectors; (c) Coordinate with emergency response services (e.g. emergency services, mobile health care, medical association) to promote precautionary measures on time; (d) Coordinate with pharmacies to inform customers about possible problems related to heat stress and pharmaceuticals.</li>
<li>Special focus on vulnerable population groups. A heat hotline is available at the Federal Office for Food Safety (AGES) for the general public in case of longer heatwaves.</li>
<li>Monitoring of mortality and morbidity associated with periods of heat stress.</li>
<li>Report to the Health Minister and the general public on the activities developed during the year.</li>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Governmental institutions at national and regional levels were involved in the elaboration of the plan and work together taking on different roles during various stages of the plan operation. Other involved actors are health professionals, hospitals and other emergency staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Communications regarding alert levels and corresponding risk reduction actions required are issued to the media by the National Met Service (ZAMG). Printed material on how to reduce risks are widely available in clinics and other locations targeting vulnerable groups such as the homes of the elderly. Information is also available online on the Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs website as well as on the website of the regional health authorities.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The national alert warning system starts to be better known nationally, and previous experiences from two regions (Styria and Carinthia) served as a good basis for its development in Austria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of the provinces Styria and Carinthia, a targeted e-mail with detailed prognosis, tips and links for further information is sent to all relevant actors. The details are showcased in the respective plans. For example in Styria the provincial health authorities developed a data pool for all relevant organisations to be informed. This data pool is exchanged with the ZAMG and used as distribution list for heat-warnings. At the beginning of the hot season all relevant organisations in Styria receive general information for the heat protection plan. As soon as possible, after an alert level is activated, an e-mail with regional forecasts, including information sheets and additional relevant information is sent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the province of Vienna, a preventive heat warning service in cooperation with ZAMG warns all relevant actors in this field and provides tips and suggestions for measures (Vienna heat guidebook) to the general public. The heat warning service was developed after the heat wave of 2003 with different actors within the city of Vienna, the ZAMG as well as the medical University and the Vienna Regional Health Insurance Fund. Since 2010 a preventive heat warning service is in place for the Vienna citizens that warn in case that a heat level is exceeded for at least three days in a row. The information is spread to the citizen via a webpage of the city of Vienna and provincial media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How the national alert warning system will reduced actually adverse health effects will be difficult to assess, and there is currently no information available, besides the quantitative number of clicks on the heat warnings at the National Met Service (ZAMG). The collaboration in the development of the plan between the national and regional level as well as actors in the health sector will allow a realistic risk assessments based on early warning information and thus ensure a faster response within the health system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important success issue is the introduction of different temperature cut off values used to trigger alters in each region. However, this is a part of the plan that will be decided between the provinces and the National Met Service (ZAMG) which can benefit from more refined information.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan is fully funded by the Ministry of Health and Woman´s Affairs. Staff working on this plan also works in other areas of prevention thus making it very difficult to estimate the costs and resources associated with the plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By definition the benefits of this plan is prevention of adverse health effects. Measuring these benefits is difficult and has not yet been analysed or calculated, but since the plan is in force for the first time in 2017, the impacts will be monitored and evaluated in the coming years.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Operation of the Portuguese Contingency Heatwaves Plan]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Evidence that elevated temperatures can lead to increased mortality and morbidity is well documented, with population vulnerability being location specific. The elderly are particular vulnerable to extreme heat stress. Being part of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal has a mild Mediterranean climate. Climate change projections indicate that the number of days with extreme heat in Portugal will increase with urban areas being more sensitive. If future populations become more urbanized and the number of elderly continues to increase, the issue of heat-related mortality will likely become more severe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the 2003 heatwave in Europe, Portugal was one of the few countries that already had an early warning system in place: but only for Lisbon, the capital city. Following the 2003 heatwave, the Portuguese Heatwave Contingency Plan was established and has been in operation every year from May to September. This is a national plan covering the whole continental Portugal. The aim of the current Portuguese Heatwave Contingency Plan is to prevent the adverse health effects of heat stress on the population during periods of elevated temperatures. Daily alerts are key factors to the successful implementation of this plan; they indicate what protection measures must be carried out to protect the population during periods of elevated temperatures.</p>
]]></field_information>
    <field_keywords><![CDATA[Mortality, Contingency plan, heatwave, morbidity, elderly people, Lisbon, early warning system]]></field_keywords>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Population vulnerability to elevated temperatures is depended on the state of the health and socio-economic conditions of the individual, the health system, the specific location and the frequency with which extreme temperatures occur in that location. Each of these is a complex and challenging topic. Successful implementation of a national heatwave contingency plan requires that information on all these topics are known, monitored and corrective measures are taken when required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Exposure to elevated temperatures is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Evidence from time-series studies in European cities show a clear association between elevated temperatures and mortality from respiratory conditions. Older individuals are known to be particularly vulnerable during extreme summer temperatures. The latter is attributable to the reduced thermoregulatory responses in these subjects and, in some cases, to the presence of chronic diseases, limited mobility and not being self-sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change projections indicate that the number of days with extreme heat in Portugal will increase with urban areas being more sensitive. If future populations become more urbanized and the number of elderly continues to increase, the issue of heat-related mortality will likely become more severe.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of the Portuguese Heatwave Contingency Plan is to prevent the adverse health impacts from elevated temperatures, also considering the possible impacts of climate change. This is achieved by providing timely relevant information to local authorities to enable them to conduct risk assessments and suitable corrective measures. Special attention is placed on the elderly population. This Plan establishes roles and functions for governmental institutions at national, regional and local level. Although it is coordinated centrally by the Directorate-General of Health, it has a de-centralized operational structure.</p>

    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Main elements and actions foreseen by the Plan include:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Definition of roles and responsibilities for each authority involved in the Plan operation. Within the Health Sector, roles and responsibilities involve national, regional and municipal levels. The Plan also establishes protocols of operations with other sectors such as Protection Services (including Metrological services) and Social Services.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Daily alerts to the general public regarding the state of hazard related to extreme temperature and heat waves. Three possible alert levels are considered: (i) Green, indicating normal temperatures for that time of year; (ii) Yellow, indicating that temperatures are high and likely to cause adverse health effects in the most sensitive population; (iii) Red, indicating extremely high temperatures likely to cause significant adverse health effects.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For each alert level specific protection measures are established to reduce possible adverse health impacts; for example, during a red alert level: (a) Inform the general population, health establishments, social services, and relevant media channels of the alert level and recommend what protective measures (i.e. drinking of water) that can be applied to reduce heat-stress; (b) Enhance communication channels between the health sector and other sectors; (c) Articulate with emergency response services to promote transportation to emergency units in hospitals and temporary locations with access to air conditioners; (d) Ensure vulnerable population groups are not alone during this period; (e) Ensure that health establishment emergency response units have additional capacity.</li>

How this has reduced adverse health effects is more difficult to assess, and there is currently no information available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Plan has been operational nationally since 2004; during this period there have been various adjustments to allow for better implementation. One of the biggest changes included shifting the implementation tasks from central government to regional and local governments, thus allowing for more realistic risk assessments and faster responses within the health system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important change was introducing different temperature cut off values used to trigger alters in each region. However, this is a part of the Plan that could still benefit of more refined information. The current definition of a heatwave (or period with extreme heat) is based on the statistical comparison of predicted climate with climate data expected for that period in that region. Conducting assessments in each region to determine the threshold based on local population sensitivity and climate would likely be more efficient.</p>

    <field_title><![CDATA[Implementation of the Heat-Health Action Plan of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]]></field_title>
    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Heat-Health Action Plan has been developed within the National Strategy for Adaptation for the health sector to implement adaptation measures and prevent health consequences associated with extreme heat due to climate change. Its goal is to decrease morbidity connected with heat waves through issuing heat and health warnings, to encourage planning in the relevant sectors, to mainstream health in all policies, and to raise the public and health sector workers’ awareness, as well as to mobilize the resources for managing the heat effects.</p>

    <field_regions><![CDATA[Continental]]></field_regions>
    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Models project an increase of mean annual temperature in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of between 2.5°C and 3°C by the end of the century. Periods of very cold weather are projected to become less common, and periods of very hot weather (heat-waves) more common. Application of the epidemiological concept of “attributable risk” to meteorological data allows assessing the extent to which human influence on climate has contributed to the risk of a specific weather event. Using this approach, a significant role for human influence can already be identified, for example, the case of the mega summer heat-wave that contributed to over 70,000 premature deaths in Western Europe in 2003 or of the Balkan summer heat-wave that contributed to over 1000 premature deaths in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2007. The absolute highest air temperatures in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were recorded in July 2007: 43.5°С in Štip, 45.3°С in Gevgelija and 45.7°С in Demir Kapija (the highest recorded temperature since continual meteorological recording and surveillance in the country). The city of Skopje is the only urban agglomeration in the country that experiences a “urban heat island” effect. The difference in total average monthly mortality in absolute numbers is 30% (from +17 to -13) between January (the month with the highest mortality) and September (with the lowest). The heat threshold temperature for Skopje in summer 2007 was 30.8°C (95th percentile daily mean temperature). Under conditions of heat–wave, an increase of temperature of 1°C above this heat threshold (30.8°C) lead to increase in mortality of 4.8%.</p>
]]></field_challenges>
    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Reduction of heat-wave-related morbidity and mortality through heat health warnings, especially for most vulnerable groups to the effects of heat-waves: the elderly, infants and children up to five years old, the chronically ill, people who are overweight, people in certain professions who work outdoors, people whose socioeconomic status makes them more vulnerable and those who are more vulnerable to the effects of heat-waves because of certain social factors (nationality, profession, education, social isolation, etc.). The health care system in the country has an important role in establishing adaptation, health prevention and response measures to address the health risks related to climate change such as:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Strengthening existing public health capacities for early detection and adequate response;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Anticipating the consequences of emerging diseases possibly related to climate change;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Raising awareness among the population about the possible links between climate change and health.</li>
</ul>]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main proposed solution is the setting up of a structured system for timely announcement of heat waves (Alert system), especially functioning in the period 01 May – 30 September. This included: the set-up of a responsible body, a 24-48 hour heat early warning, specific thresholds for action, and priorities for vulnerable populations, workers’ health and communication. The Alert system is part of the broader approach designed by the National Heat-Health Action Plan. Further elements are:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Coordination body for implementing the plan;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plan for informing (communication) the public and the health and social sectors about protection during heat waves, in particular in relation to the recommendations given by the Ministry of Health, addressed to the health workers, the population and risk groups;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Recommendations for reducing exposure to heat inside health and social institutions (medium-term and short-term strategies), and special protection plans for vulnerable population groups;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Long term planning for preparedness of the health and social care systems, including: planning and training of personnel, appropriate health protection, creating green areas, improving the energy efficiency of the hospitals and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Monitoring and evaluation of the plan.</li>
</ul><p>An application for Android mobile phones was also developed; it provides heat and health warnings and related recommendations to the users.</p>

]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The institution with overall responsibility for implementing the Heat-Health Action Plan is the Ministry of Health. Within the Ministry of Health, the Commission for Monitoring Heat-Health Consequences has been operational since July 2007, while the Climate Change and Health Commission was established in June 2009. This latter participates in the carrying out, and surveillance of, a wide range of activities connected to climate change and health. Both commissions have participated in the preparation of the National Heat-Health Action Plan and they cooperate in the execution, surveillance and evaluation of the Plan. The Climate Change and Health Commission functions as coordinating body and is responsible for the coordination of the involvement of institutions during the implementation of the activities outlined in the Plan, as well as promoting multi-sectoral cooperation. The Commission for Monitoring Heat-Health Consequences oversees practical implementation of the activities, especially those connected with the provision of timely information to the public and health workers. It is responsible for implementing actions and activating the Plan. It is recommended that when necessary, people from other relevant institutions are included in this Commission and in the Plan implementation, as: Public Health Institute and Public Health Centres, the Occupational Health Institute - WHO Collaborating Centre, Crisis Management Centre, Hydrometeorological Institute, Directorate for Protection and Rescue, Departments for improving the living environment within the municipalities (in the ﬁrst phase, active participation of the City of Skopje), Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Education and Science, Macedonian Red Cross, Media, Non-governmental sector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">For the preparation of this plan the World Health Organization in collaboration with the Ministry of Health organized two workshops: (i) First workshop for preparing the health action plan for hot weather, 21-22 May, 2009, Skopje; (ii) Second workshop for revising and supplementing the work version of the plan, 21 October, 2009, Skopje.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">In the current implementation phase this collaborative approach has proven to work well. For instance, in order to strengthen preparedness for crisis situations and climate change related emergencies, a simulation exercise took place on 22 May 2013, in Strumica Region in the country. The key stakeholders were Ministry of Health, Strumica General Hospital (an important regional hospital centre), Emergency Medical Services, Crisis Management Centre, the Red Cross, fire-rescue units, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Defence and WHO. Prior to the simulation exercise some preparatory meetings were held to establish the parameters of the exercise such as expected casualties, trigger indicators for activating the emergency response plan, triage and patient traffic flow as well as the responsibilities of hospital and emergency medical services staff. The simulation allowed the authorities to test general preparedness and also the implementation of the National Heat-Health Action Plan.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The first pilot implementation was in summer 2010 and the Plan was endorsed by the Government in 2011. Lessons learning during the process 2009-2011 can be summarised as follow: (i) information on climate change impacts needs to be translated from the scientific research domain into language and time scales relevant for policy makers; (ii) the needs for national data were very important as well as recognition of limited human capacity; (iii) all relevant stakeholders need to be involved, but their needs for information may vary. More broadly, strengthening health security would require:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Maximizing synergies with existing instruments, including the Heat-Health Action Plan;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Preparing health and social care sector workforce to respond to health-related consequences of climate change and strengthening of health services to address climate-related events in a timely manner;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Promoting consideration of the health issues and related responses within other sectors;</li>

The overall goal of the project was to strengthen capacity in understanding and responding to the health risks of climate change as well as to develop the Heat-Health Action Plan. Within the Project a WHO study in the country showed that it is possible to compare the damage costs of the increase in disease cases and deaths that were not averted with the costs of adaptation; moreover a partial reduction in health impacts is an expected benefit as a result of adaptation measures implemented. The annualized costs of heat-health adaptation measures were estimated at 12 million local currency units (LocalU) compared to health damage costs of 170 million LocalU per year (Climate change and health: a tool to estimate health and adaptation costs. Copenhagen, WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2013).</p>

    <field_information><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This case describes the steps taken towards achieving more balanced management of Cork Harbour, through the establishment of a strategic alliance (couplet) between the local authority and multidisciplinary academic experts. This innovative partnership resulted in the adoption of an Integrated Management Strategy. A stakeholder group – Harbour Management Focus Group (HMFG) – comprising statutory and non-statutory organisations was established to implement the management strategy. Subsequent to this exercise, the couplet again worked with the HMFG to investigate risks associated with climate change; this process culminated in the preparation of an Adaptation Strategy for Cork Harbour, focusing on flood management by 2030.</p>

    <field_challenges><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">To orientate the elaboration of the climate change Adaptation Strategies for the Cork Harbour an Issues Workshop was held in Cork under the EU-funded IMCORE project in May 2009. The key issue identified in relation to climate change was the increased flooding due to changes in precipitation patterns, storm patterns and sea level rise, and the related impacts. Historically, flooding has had negative social and economic implications, especially for residents and business owners in vulnerable areas of the City Centre. As a result, flood risk management came to dominate discussions of adaptation to both current conditions and future climate change. Cork City's low-lying location and geographical position within the River Lee's Catchment area means that the central business district of the City and the towns within the Harbour are at risk of flooding. Agricultural areas located upstream on the River Lee Catchment Area are also at increased risk of flooding due to more frequent intense rain events. There are a significant number of key economic assets such as port facilities, electrical and water services, road and rail transportation links, and significant employment areas, as well as loss of habitat and biodiversity, cultural and heritage sites and population centres adjoining coastal areas of the harbour, which are at increased risk of flooding from higher sea levels and changes in precipitation and storm patterns.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Whilst flooding is the primary consideration, other expected changes, such as changes in storm patterns and meteorological conditions, would have obvious effects on maritime activities of the Cork Harbour including recreational and Port activities.</p>

    <field_objectives><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Develop an ICZM framework and a local climate change adaptation strategy for Cork Harbour through the establishment of a strategic partnership (couplet) between the local authority and multidisciplinary academic experts (strengthening links between science and policy making at the local level) and through stakeholders’ participation.</p>
]]></field_objectives>
    <field_solutions><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Cork Harbour is a large natural harbour located on the southern coast of Ireland and exerts a considerable influence on the City of Cork. The topography of the landscape is gently undulating, with a mixed coastline consisting of built infrastructure, shallow cliffs, intertidal mudflats, reed beds, shingle and rocky foreshores. The area is particularly important for birdlife and is designated as both a Ramsar wetland site and a Special Protection Area for birds. The Harbour provides a natural public amenity; natural assets enjoyed by local communities include an attractive coastline, and is also a location with a rich maritime heritage. Because of the geographic scope and sheltered nature of Cork Harbour it has a long tradition of recreational boating, including sailing, fishing and power boating. The physical geography of the Harbour on the south coast of Ireland provides a strategic location for the Port of Cork situated in close proximity to the main shipping line to northern Europe. Port operations are distributed throughout the Harbour, from a city centre location to the ferry terminal at Ringaskiddy. The presence of gas fields offshore from Cork Harbour has resulted in the location of many exploration companies in the Harbour over the last 30 years. Moreover, Cork Harbour is a hub for pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">This case describes the steps taken towards achieving more balanced management of a multi-use environment such as Cork Harbour. It includes the integration of risk associated with climate change, through the establishment of a strategic alliance (couplet) between the local authority and multidisciplinary academic experts (Coastal and Marine Research Centre - CMRC, University College Cork and Cork County Council). This innovative relationship resulted in the adoption of an Integrated Management Strategy for Cork Harbour (COREPOINT, 2008) set up with the consensus of stakeholders and a strengthened link between science and policy at the local level. The implementation of this Strategy was then progressed again through INTERREG IVB NWE under Innovative Management for Europe’s Changing Coastal Resource (IMCORE) project, which had a more pronounced focus on climate change adaptation (and the addition of National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI, joining the couplet).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">The main objective of the approach was to move towards the establishment of an ICZM framework strategy for the Harbour and better integration of science-based knowledge in the planning and management regime, strengthening the link between science and policy. This was to be done with stakeholder participation and consensus. These goals were to be achieved in a mid-term timescale (3-5 years).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Using the stakeholder partnership formed to develop the integrated coastal management strategy for the Harbour, a process to develop a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Harbour and its vicinity was initiated under the IMCORE project. This involved participatory processes similar to those used in developing the Integrated Management Strategy, coupled with the use of scenarios to help visualise various options for the Harbour area under different climate change circumstances. The primary impact of concern to most stakeholders was flooding and a visualisation model was developed to present this to stakeholders. The process culminated in the preparation of an Adaptation Strategy for Cork Harbour, focusing on the desired future for flood management to 2030. The Strategy identifies actions and activities (and related delivery period and responsibility) in various fields, for example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Political, including the actions: Robust decision making processes and structures to be instituted, Planning to have a longer term, strategic focus;</li>
<li>Economic, including the actions: Critical infrastructure to become flood resilient, Business and residents of Cork to have continued access to flood insurance provision;</li>
<li>Social, including the action: Society to have a proactive involvement in building resilience to, and effectively coping with, flood events;</li>
<li>Technological, including the actions: Timely and accurate prediction of flood magnitude and extent, Early warning system to be instituted that would alert Cork citizens and businesses of likelihood of flooding;</li>
<li>Legal, including the actions: Integration of planning processes to ensure coherent flood management responses, Systems of monitoring and evaluation of policy performance to be instituted and acted upon;</li>
<li>Environmental, including the actions: Environmental management to be informed by system approaches, Ecosystem no longer managed using a designed area approach, Flood water buffering potential of natural and built environment maximised.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The content of the adaptation strategy will be reflected in forthcoming local authority planning policy, as a result of climate change adaptation becoming a legal responsibility of local authorities under new legislation.</p>

    <field_adaptation><![CDATA[<p>Case developed and implemented and partially funded as a CCA measure.</p>
]]></field_adaptation>
    <field_stakeholder><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A Harbour Management Focus Group (HMFG) was established to help implement the Integrated Management Strategy for Cork Harbour. The HMFG is made of up representatives from key statutory and non-statutory bodies involved in the day-to-day management of the Harbour including chambers of commerce, local authorities, port companies and development agencies. Two academic institutions, the National Maritime College of Ireland and University College Cork (CMRC), are also represented. There is involvement of national government departments (Department of Agriculture, Food &#38; the Marine; Department of Environment, Community &#38; Local Government) as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Industrial Development Agency, Irish Naval Service, Fáilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The strategy was developed following consultation with stakeholders from Cork Harbour during a series of workshops, interviews and public meetings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Stakeholder engagement in the context of understanding climate change impacts was undertaken as part the IMCORE project; in May 2009 an Issues Workshop was held in Cork. This aimed to identify and discuss the local issues associated with climate change. Flood management (to 2030) emerged as the most important issue in the Cork Harbour area. An exploratory scenario workshop was then conducted in April 2010 to identify the drivers of change affecting this issue. Subsequent to this, IMCORE staff used the data gathered to develop four exploratory scenario narratives. These four narratives were presented to the HMFG for discussion and validation which culminated in the development of a “fifth scenario” narrative outlining a desired future for flood management in Cork Harbour to 2030. It is these actions that form the basis of an adaptive management strategy for Cork Harbour to climate change.</p>
]]></field_stakeholder>
    <field_factors><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the Integrated Management Strategy and the Adaptation Strategy for Cork Harbour have been agreed by multiple stakeholders in the Harbour area. The former has influenced how the resource value and development considerations of the Harbour are communicated in the latest iteration of statutory spatial planning and development documents, and initiated a more in depth analysis to the planning needs of the Harbour, since undertaken by the local authority. The process has developed institutional capacity in adaptation planning and strategy development, and has fostered greater levels of information sharing across agencies and organisations to better inform activities targeted at coastal management and climate adaptation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Lack of available time and a limited legal local authority remit for the marine environment together along with the absence of a national policy for coastal management affected the progress of the ICZM process in the initial stages of the Harbour Integrated Management Strategy. During the course of development of the Harbour Adaptation Strategy, the same key stakeholders were involved in the process but at the time they had little or no remit for climate change or its impacts. Possibly as a result, their understanding of the topic was not as strong as for other areas (e.g. spatial planning, coastal management), however, all participants realised that climate change might have implications for their area of work in the future.</p>
]]></field_factors>
    <field_budget><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Integrated Management Strategy and the Adaptation Strategy for Cork Harbour have been developed through a voluntary process, co-ordinated through funding provided through the COREPOINT and IMCORE projects.</p>
]]></field_budget>
    <field_legal><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, the management of Cork Harbour is characterised by a sectoral approach, with a strong land/marine divide. The Integrated Management Strategy does not have a statutory (legal) basis but rather is based on a voluntary partnership between key statutory agencies and local stakeholders who focus their attention on the Harbour as a whole and deliver a set of agreed actions to enhance the future management of the coastal zone. Stakeholders participating in the Harbour Management Focus Group benefit from the opportunity to share information and scope out collaboration to pursue areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">Climate change adaptation, arguably, had stronger drivers in both law and policy than ICZM and consequently it was somewhat ‘easier’ to get buy-in to the process. It was also widely anticipated that climate change adaptation would become a responsibility of local authorities once new legislation had been enacted. This presented the local authority concerned, Cork County Council, with a unique opportunity to be involved in the development of such a strategy, with a tailored methodology, from the outset. Whilst the strategy prepared under IMCORE covers only the Cork Harbour area and is non-statutory, it does go some way towards preparing and developing the capacity of the local authority personnel for their future regulatory role in elaborating adaptation plans.</p>
